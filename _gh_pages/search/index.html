            "content": "Accessibility\n\nTizen provides users with a universal design, which presents the same level and quality of user experience regardless of the accessibility level of the individuals.\n\nAccessibility levels of individuals vary. Users may have impaired sight, hearing, or other impairments. All user needs must be considered to create a universal design. Tizen provides a screen reader and larger font sizes to effectively convey information to users with different needs.\n\nDeveloping an accessible app may not be easy. When you design an accessible app, there are many things that require your attention and consideration. However, your app design does not have to be limited by users with disabilities. Highly accessible apps are easy to use for everyone, after all.\n\nBy adding accessibility features to your app, you can ensure that it conforms to accessibility related laws, regulations, and standards. We are planning on increasing and fortifying support for accessibility features with Tizen. This will open an opportunity to help you develop more and more competitive apps.\n\nTizen Screen Reader\n\nThe screen reader feature was developed to assist users with poor sights. By reading text information to the users, it enables them to use apps without struggling with the small text information on the screen.\n\n   \n\nUsing this feature, you can design an app to provide a pleasant user experience to users with poor eyesight. It utilizes a TTS (text-to-speech) engine to transform the text and graphics on the screen into audible information. The screen reader recognizes the selected information or user interface, and provides audible feedback if a subsequent action is required.\n\nBecause Tizen 2.4 fully supports the screen reader feature, you do not have to add additional graphical elements to your app to enable it.\n\nThe following are guidelines for designing apps that support the screen reader.\n\nGuidelines for Designing Reader-Compatible Content\n\nProvide Meaningful Labels for Graphical Elements\n\nTizen is capable of automatically transforming all the text information used with the UI components into audible information. However, to design an app that is fully compatible with the TTS feature, you should label the graphical elements in your app.\n\nWe recommend that you label the user interface components, such as graphical buttons, icons, and tabs, with intuitive and meaningful names. If a component is used to carry out three or more tasks, list each task by the sequence of execution.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      1. Favorite on / off 2. Queue 3. Volume 4. Shuffle on / off 5. Previous track : double-tap and hold to rewind 6. Play / Pause 7. Next track : double-tap and hold to fast-forward 8. Repeat on / off / once\n    \n  \n  \n    \n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nInformative labels for graphical elements\n\nAdditional labeling is not required if you use the controls provided by the system in your app. Tizen provides labels, trait information, and optional attributes attached to the default user controls. For example, a radio button comes with a label text and a trait (selected/unselected), and a slider for screen brightness control comes with a label, a trait (%n of %n), and an optional attribute (flick up and down to adjust the position).\n\nIf you need to design your own controls for your app, refer to the examples of the system controls and label it with meaningful information to help users.\n\nProvide a Predictable Flow\n\nDesign screens that allow users to easily predict the navigational flow. Provide a conventional and consistent layout that uses left-to-right and top-to-bottom swipe actions to ensure that your app to has a predictable navigational flow for easy focus transition.\n\nThe focus transition on the screen takes place in a linear manner. Therefore, it is always best to place the user controls in a linear manner as well to match the flow.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how the Screen Reader Works\n\nRead and understand the basic interactions between an action and the screen reader before labeling the UI components for your app.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Action\n      Symbol\n      Result when the Screen Reader is Enabled\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Tap\n      \n      Selects and reads the item under your finger.\n    \n    \n      Double tap\n      \n      Activates the selected itemActivates edit mode (selects editable text)\n    \n    \n      Double tap and hold\n      \n      Allows users to drag an icon or view more options for selected items\n    \n    \n      Left swipe\n      \n      Moves to previous / next items\n    \n    \n      Right swipe\n      \n      Moves to previous / next items\n    \n    \n      2-finger tap\n      \n      Pauses / resumes text-to-speech.\n    \n    \n      2-finger Left swipe\n      \n      Changes pages / screens\n    \n    \n      2-finger Right swipe\n      \n      Changes pages / screens\n    \n  \n\n\nAdjustable Font Size\n\nInclude font size options to increase accessibility. The following example shows how text elements are affected by changes in font sizes.\n\n\n\nItems affected by the font size setting : List\n\n\n\nItems affected by the font size setting : Controls\n\n\n\nItems affected by the font size setting : Radio buttons\n\n\n\nItems affected by the font size setting : Description\n",

            "title": "Air",
            "content": "“Air”\n\n“Air” is one of the inspirations behind the Tizen design. The concept was introduced to achieve the key principles of openness, flow, curiosity, and focus. “Air” is a conceptual element that inspires an open, flexible, and rich visual experience. Designs should be created to satisfy users with visually reinforced presentations.\n\nThe Origins of the “Air” Concept\n\n“Air” interacts with “Ground,” “Atmosphere,” and “Wind,” to create different results.\n\n“Ground” symbolizes the structure and layout of the Tizen design. “Atmosphere” is the subtle variations of the “Air” principles, such as colors, themes, and overall design variations. “Wind” is created by the flow and movement of “Air.” For Tizen, it symbolizes visually pleasing motion graphics designs.\n\nNatural Elements in the Design Language\n\n“GROUND”: Bold and Distinctive Layout Design\n\n\n\nRidges are formed where air touches the ground\n\nIn our design language, “Ground” is the first element “Air” touches. Solid structural designs powered by Tizen provide distinctive divisions on which all the other design elements are placed. Across all applicable platforms, such structural distinctiveness leads to glanceable and quickly recognizable designs.\n\nThe “Air” concept embraces the beauty of less and pursues minimalism in the layout. It aims to provide only the essential content based on actual needs. Therefore, the “Air” concept may not reveal its full potential at first look.\n\n“ATMOSPHERE”: Natural Tones, Colors, and Moods\n\n“Atmosphere” represents natural tones, colors, and moods present in the design. Inspired by the colorful gradients found in nature, such as deep blue skies with a slight hint of white cloud, sunrises, sunsets, and the Northern Lights, “Atmosphere” emphasizes the use of color gradients to achieve a natural, aesthetic design. A well-implemented “Atmosphere” can vastly enhance user experience.\n\n \n\nColor inspiration from nature\n\nUsing light, “Atmosphere” aims to achieve natural transition of colors as they are found in the sky. With carefully selected colors, “Atmosphere” creates natural, yet appealing color gradients.\n\nWe recommend contrasting color combinations in the background and foreground to ensure optimal readability. The use of subtle gradient prevents high-contrast screens from becoming boring by adding variations that keep the screen visually intriguing.\n\n“WIND”: Animated Graphics from Nature\n\nThe “Wind” concept is based on animations providing users with feedback for each interaction, while conveying meaningful information to help orient users. For example, page-turning effects visually suggest the direction of navigation, and page-end effects inform users that they have reached the last page of the current content. Uniform, harmonious animations on the screen allow for a pleasant visual experience while maximizing the responsiveness of the design.\n\n\n\nThe wind is the flow of the content\n\nTizen screens have a multilayered structure. Each layer has its own directional flow, based on the uses and features, for consistent screen transition. Difference in direction helps users clearly identify which layer, level, or part of the design the interaction is taking place on.\n\nAnimation effects also include fade effects for transitions between layers and for opening and closing app screens.\n",

            "content": "Animations\n\nThe idea of on-screen animation effects in the Tizen UI was inspired by the behavior of wind. We aim to reproduce the wind’s natural movements on the screen to provide a more organic and aesthetic experience for users.\n\nThe Look and Feel of a Gentle Breeze\n\nThe concept of fluid animation design represents the look and feel of a gentle breeze. Objects glide across the screen as if they were blown by a gentle breeze.\n\n\n  &lt;source src=\"media/animations_doencoded.webm\" type=video/webm&gt;\n\n\nDo (Click to play)\n\n\n  &lt;source src=\"media/animations_donsencoded.webm\" type=video/webm&gt;\n\n\nDon’t (Click to play)\n\nConsistent Flow\n\nAnimations on the screen should have a consistent direction. Disorienting animations create visual noise and confuse users. Uniform animation effects that take place in a timely manner can maximize usability by enhancing understanding of what is occurring on the screen.\n\n\n  Avoid overusing animations. Add animations to tasks only if they are related to the task and can enhance users’ understanding of the task. Meaningless, irrelevant animations only add confusion.\n\n\n\n  &lt;source src=\"media/2.5_c_1.webm\" type=video/webm&gt;\n\n\nDo (Click to play)\n\n\n  &lt;source src=\"media/2.5_d_1.webm\" type=video/webm&gt;\n\n\nDon’t (Click to play)\n\nWhen you design animations for different layers on the screen, provide them based on the actual movement of the layer they belong to.\n\n\n\nDesign your motions work in harmony\n\nIf necessary, you can design animations with different styles on the same screen. However, if you design a screen with multiple simultaneous animations, they should be consistent and uniform.\n\nSubtle Dispersion\n\nAnimations that convey the idea of dispersion may be applied to user interfaces, such as buttons and icons.\n\nWhen you design animations for buttons or icons, there are a few rules to follow to maximize the effect and avoid confusion:\n\n\n  Intrigue users by providing a hint that the UI is motion-ready.\n  Keep the original shape of the UI to avoid confusion.\n  Orient the animation from the center to the edge of the UI.\n  Ensure that users clearly recognize the animation effect. To make the effect visible, design the initial animation in a size no less than 80% of the UI size, and then allow it to grow to 100%.\n\n\n\n  &lt;source src=\"media/2.5_h_1.webm\" type=video/webm&gt;\n\n\nDo (Click to play)\n\n\n  &lt;source src=\"media/2.5_i_1.webm\" type=video/webm&gt;\n\n\nDon’t (Click to play)\n",

Since building packages with dependency cycles is not supported by GBS, it is impossible to build all packages locally with GBS for Tizen:[&lt;Tizen version&gt;]:Base. Therefore, a remote repo which contains RPMs built by OBS for Tizen:[&lt;Tizen version&gt;]:Base needs to be added in the .gbs.conf file.\n      In Tizen versions lower than Tizen 2.3, there is only 1 OBS project and packages with dependency cycles are included in it. To continue the build by breaking the dependency cycles for Tizen versions lower than Tizen 2.3, see Excluding Specific Packages.\n    \n  \n  Accelerator packages\n    \n      Tizen provides cross-compilers and other accelerator packages. For Tizen versions 2.4 and higher, these accelerator packages are included in the Tizen:[&lt;Tizen version&gt;]:Base OBS project.\n      For Tizen versions lower than Tizen 2.3, there is only 1 OBS project and the accelerator packages are included in it. These packages have names ending with -x64 and need to be excluded to build locally with GBS. Otherwise, built out packages are installed and used, and the accelerator packages fail to work. To exclude these accelerator packages for Tizen versions lower than Tizen 2.3, see Excluding Specific Packages.\n    \n  \n\n",

            "title": "Colors",
            "content": "Colors\n\nColors play an important role in creating designs for a rich visual experience. Carefully selected colors add rhythm and richness to the screen design and provide the entire system with visual consistency.\n\nTizen provides various color palettes to help you select colors to indicate different functions of on-screen objects.\n\nThis section provides information about the new default theme color since the Tizen SDK 2.4 and explains the system colors (functional colors) used to indicate different functions.\n\n\nThe new Tizen themes use gradients as the background.\n\nTizen features background gradients for both mobile and wearable devices by default. The system automatically transforms single-colored backgrounds into gradients by shifting hues and applying a slight shimmer.\n\nTizen mobile and wearable devices have different background schemes. While mobile devices use blue gradient schemes, wearable devices use darker background schemes based on the colors of the Aurora Borealis.\n\nRefer to Mobile Styles and Wearable Styles for platform-specific style guidelines.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIf you choose to design your own theme gradient, be careful about the gradient directions and range of colors. Avoid disorienting gradients and grayscale gradients to create a theme that is consistent with the overall Tizen visual experience.\n\n\n\nDisorienting gradient direction\n\nDefault System Colors\n\nFor basic action buttons, such as Go and Stop, Tizen 2.4 uses clear, distinct colors for focus and emphasis. Transparency may be applied to text colors to add subtle nuances.\n\nThe following are guidelines for choosing colors for your app design.\n\nAvoid Button Colors Already in Use for the System Icons\n\nIn the Tizen SDK, basic action buttons, such as Go and Stop are assigned with distinctive colors to accent functions. If you design your app with button colors that are already in use with these icons, users may have hard times recognizing the system icons.\n\nChoose Unique Colors for Your App\n\nYou can design your own theme, and apply it to your app to differentiate it from others. Just remember to use consistent color swatches that will enhance visual communication with users.\n\nKeep Accessibility in Mind\n\nIt is important to remember that some users may have compromised vision, such as being near-sighted or color blind. Find combinations of colors that are easily distinguishable to these users. For example, if you have to use red and green colors together in one screen to indicate functions, adjust hue and contrast to make sure that these colors are distinguishable to users with red-green color blindness.\n\nText and Background Color\n\nOn the Tizen platform, multiple layers are stacked together to produce the resulting screen colors. Since simpler colors are used in stacks, there are only a few rules to follow. These rules ensure that the combinations of colors are not unusual or unnatural.\n\nUse Light-colored Text on the Default Background (Gradient)\n\nOn both the mobile and wearable devices, white text stands out on default theme colors, while black and gray text do not. Gray text against a background gradient generally results in poor readability.\n\n \nMusic player on a mobile device\n\nAvoid Using Texts with Vivid Colors\n\nText with vivid colors, such as yellow, blue, and green may cause confusion. The following examples show that inconsistent use of vivid colors results in imbalances and distractions on the screen.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Do\n      Don’t\n    \n  \n\n\nColor Structure\n\nMultiple Color Layers\n\nThe main theme background (gradient) is placed at the bottom layer. In specific sections of the screen, multiple color layers are used to create visual depth. Text colors should be decided based on the resulting color of the stacked layers. On wearable devices, the center portion of the dark gradient layer decides the overall look and feel of the screen. App-specific colors or accent colors are placed over the center of the gradient layer. Light-colored text is recommended for wearable devices, because they use dark background colors by default.\n\n\nThree color layers with different opacities over the background\n\n\n      \n\nThe resulting screen\n\n\nTizen mobile devices use the same multilayered background structure. However, for mobile devices, the main theme background (gradient) is placed at the bottom layer.\n\n\nScreen structure for Tizen mobile devices.

The Tizen Compliance Program is valuable to the following audiences:\n\n\n  Application developers: Know how to create compatible applications that work across multiple devices, and how Tizen devices behave.\n  Tizen device implementers: Know how to implement a Tizen-compliant device by satisfying software and hardware requirements.\n  Carriers: Know how to customize and enhance a device, while remaining within compliance guidelines.\n  End users: Know that applications work on their device and are assured of a consistent user experience among compliant devices and applications.\n\n\nTo become Tizen compliant, a device must obtain the Tizen Compliance certification.\n\nTizen Compliance Model\n\nTo be called Tizen compliant, a Tizen device implementer must obtain the Tizen Compliance certification for the device for at least 1 Tizen profile. This involves satisfying the requirements of the Tizen Compliance Specification, passing all of the Tizen Compliance Tests, then applying to the Tizen Association for certification.\n\nA Tizen profile describes the requirements for a category of Tizen devices that have a common application execution environment. Applications are created for a specific target profile and can run on devices compliant with that profile.\n\nEach Tizen profile is based on the Tizen Common libraries, which are a set of libraries common across all Tizen platforms. The set of libraries helps to unify multiple device categories by sharing common platform components.\n\nThe currently-available profiles are:\n\n\n  Mobile: for handsets and tablets\n  Wearable: for watches\n  TV: for DTV/STB/IPTV systems\n\n\nAdditional profiles are expected in the future, potentially including:\n\n\n  IVI: for In-Vehicle Infotainment systems\n\n\nFigure: Tizen profiles\n\n\n\nThe Tizen Compliance Tests measure conformance to the requirements of a given Tizen profile.\n\nCompliance Certification Steps\n\nTo get a Tizen device certified:\n\n\n  A Tizen device implementer gets the Tizen source code and creates a new Tizen device.\n  A Tizen device implementer obtains the compliance specification (TCS), compliance tests (TCT), and Tizen branding request form .\n  Once the new Tizen device passes 100% of the compliance tests, the Tizen device implementer submits the test results with a Tizen branding request form to the Tizen Association.\n  The Tizen Association reviews, approves, and certifies the device as Tizen compliant. Any technical review required to decide approval or failure is referred to the Tizen Steering Group by the Tizen Association.\n\n\nFeedback\n\nThe Tizen Project welcomes feedback and input on Tizen Compliance. If a Tizen device implementer has questions or concerns about the specification or compliance tests, they are welcome to discuss these on the Tizen compliance mailing list.\n",

            "content": "Connectivity\n\nYou can implement various connectivity features, such as Bluetooth, WLAN, and NFC.\n\nBluetooth\n\nBluetooth is a short range communication protocol used to communicate between 2 devices. Tizen uses open source Bluetooth components, such as BlueZ and ObexD. Bluez and ObexD run as a daemon and an interface library, Bluetooth Framework, is used for applications to access them over the D-Bus interface.\n\nThis section explains the Bluetooth architecture on the Tizen platform and how Tizen can be ported, along with the configuration parameters and their values.\n\nFigure: Tizen Bluetooth architecture\n\n\n\nThe Bluetooth framework provides a dialogue for the user to control the BlueZ, ObexD, and PulseAudio daemons. Bluetooth provides a standard interface between the Bluetooth chip and AP, called the HCI (Host Controller Interface). HCI can be implemented on USB, UART, and SDIO, but for the mobile environment, UART is the most common. HCI activation can differ depending on the chip vendor. The vendor provides the HCI configuration and the initial scripts. For example, Broadcom and Spreadtrum provide firmware and a loading tool. Tizen supports Bluetooth version 4.2, and the GATT, FTP, OPP, MAP, PBAP, A2DP, AVRCP, HSP/HFP, RFCOMM, HID, HDP, and PAN profiles. Bluetooth Low Energy functions have been implemented in BlueZ and bluetooth-frwk.\n\nThe Tizen Bluetooth framework is based on the open source BlueZ project. BlueZ provides the DBUS API and based on it, Tizen Bluetooth framework provides the C Language API. Using the Tizen Bluetooth framework is recommended.\n\nThe following components are necessary for Bluetooth:\n\n\n  Application\n    \n      User dialogue that controls the BlueZ, ObexD, and PulseAudio daemons\n    \n  \n  ObexD\n    \n      Open source component\n      Object exchange daemon\n      Supports OPP, FTP, PBAP, SYNC, and MAP profile stack\n    \n  \n  BluetoothD\n    \n      BluetoothD is the open source component, BlueZ 5.37 is supported\n      Bluetooth central daemon\n      Supports GAP, SDP, A2DP, AVRCP, HFP, HSP, and GATT profile stack\n    \n  \n  Bluetooth subsystem\n    \n      Provides the BT unix socket.

These scripts invoke the Bluetooth chip-specific (such as Broadcom and Spreadtrum) scripts, provided by the chipset vendor to perform chip-specific configuration. These scripts are available in the bluetooth-dev-tools.under package. When this package is installed, it copies the following scripts in the /usr/etc/Bluetooth/ directory:\n\n\n  bt-stack-up.sh\n  bt-stack-down.sh\n  bt-reset-env.sh\n\n\nTizen BT Obex Profiles\n\nIn Tizen, the open source ObexD is used for the obex-based profiles:\n\n\n  BT Obex profiles server (obexd)\n  BT Obex profiles client (obex-client)\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nThere are a few configuration changes that need to be made to enable the specific chipset and the scripts and other chipset-specific configuration information, such as UART speed and UART terminal (tty).

Your Wi-Fi driver must be compatible with the standard wpa_supplicant.\n\nThe Tizen WLAN architecture is centered on the Linux wireless (IEEE-802.11) subsystem. The Linux wireless SW stack defines the WLAN hardware adaptation software interfaces that need to be used in Tizen. In practice, the required interfaces are defined by cfg80211 for FullMAC WLAN devices and by mac80211 for SoftMAC WLAN devices. In addition, a Linux network interface needs to be supported towards the Linux TCP/IP stack.\n\nThe Connection Manager (ConnMan) is a daemon for managing Internet connections within embedded devices running the Linux operating system.\n\nThe wpa_supplicant interface is a WPA Supplicant with support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN). WPA Supplicant is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA component that is used in the client stations. It implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and it controls roaming and the IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the WLAN driver.\n\nPorting the OAL Interface\n\nThe WLAN driver plugin is specific to a Wi-Fi chipset. This includes firmware and chipset-specific tools. Wi-Fi chipset firmware and tool files must be copied to the WLAN driver plugin directory, built, and installed before testing the Wi-Fi functionality. Because of Tizen platform requirements, the Wi-Fi driver must create the /opt/etc/.mac.info file, which has the device MAC address.\n\nThe WLAN driver plugin contains the wlan.sh file (located in /usr/bin/wlan.sh), which is used to load or unload the Wi-Fi driver firmware.\n\nWhen the wifi_activate() function is called, the load driver request is sent to the NET-CONFIG daemon. The NET-CONFIG daemon loads the Wi-Fi driver using the wlan.sh script file. Similarly, the wifi_deactivate() function requests unloading of the Wi-Fi driver. In case of Wi-Fi Direct®, the wifi_direct_activate() and wifi_direct_deactivate() functions make the Wi-Fi Direct manager load or unload the Wi-Fi driver using the wlan.sh script.\n\nUsing the /usr/bin/wlan.sh script:\n\n\n  wlan.sh start: Power up the Wi-Fi driver in station mode by loading the driver and running the firmware file.\n  wlan.sh p2p: Power up the Wi-Fi driver in Wi-Fi Direct mode by loading the driver and running the firmware file.\n  wlan.sh softap: Power up the Wi-Fi driver in Soft AP mode by loading the driver and running the firmware file.\n  wlan.sh stop: Power down the Wi-Fi driver.\n\n\nAll other Wi-Fi related functionality is handled by the ConnMan daemon.\n\nReferences\n\n\n  Connection Manager (ConnMan) project website: https://01.org/connman\n  Linux wireless (IEEE-802.11) subsystem: https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org\n  Information on Linux WPA/WPA2/IEEE 802.1X Supplicant: http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/\n  Latest ConnMan release: http://git.kernel.org/?p=network/connman/connman.git;a=summary\n  WLAN driver plugin Git path: /adaptation/devices/wlandrv-plugin-tizen-bcm43xx\n  Reference kernel configurations\n  The following options must be enabled if the driver supports the cfg802.11 configuration API, instead of the wireless extension API.

It is a daemon process to control the NFC chipset (such as NXP pn544). It provides the read and write service and basic P2P communication service, as well as the basic API for the client application.\n  NFC stack contains the required plugin, based on the NFC chipset. Currently, the nfc-plugin-nxp is used for the NXP chipset. The NFC plugin acts as an interface between the NFC chipset with the NFC framework (nfc-manager). It must be implemented according to the interface provided by the nfc-manager.\n\n\nPorting the OAL Interface\n\nThe NFC plugin is implemented as a shared library and it interfaces the Tizen nfc-manager and the vendor NFC chip. The NFC manager loads the libnfc-plugin.so library at runtime from the /usr/lib/libnfc-plugin.so directory. Any vendor-specific plugin is installed within the same path. The plugin must be written with predefined OAL API interfaces.\n\nDuring initialization, the nfc-manager loads the nfc-plugin.so library, searches for the onload() function, and calls the function with an interface structure instance as an argument for mapping all the OAL interfaces. These OAL/OEM interfaces are implemented according to the underlying NFC chipset. Once the mapping is done, the NFC manager interacts with nfc-plugin, which implements the vendor-specific OAL interfaces.\n\nThe following example shows the onload() function:\n\nBool\nonload(net_nfc_oem_interface_s *oem_interfaces) {\n    oem_interfaces-&gt;init = xxx;  /* xxx refers to plugin APIs */\n    oem_interfaces-&gt;deinit = xxx;\n    oem_interfaces-&gt;register_listener = xxx;\n    oem_interfaces-&gt;unregister_listener = xxx;\n    oem_interfaces-&gt;check_firmware_version = xxx;\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n\nThe NFC OAL interfaces are defined in the following structure. Use the net_nfc_oem_controller.h header file.\n\ntypedef struct _net_nfc_oem_interface_s {\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_init init;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_deinit deinit;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_register_listener register_listener;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_unregister_listener unregister_listener;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_check_firmware_version check_firmware_version;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_update_firmware update_firmware;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_get_stack_information get_stack_information;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_configure_discovery configure_discovery;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_get_secure_element_list get_secure_element_list;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_set_secure_element_mode set_secure_element_mode;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_connect connect;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_connect disconnect;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_check_ndef check_ndef;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_check_target_presence check_presence;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_read_ndef read_ndef;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_write_ndef write_ndef;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_make_read_only_ndef make_read_only_ndef;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_transceive transceive;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_format_ndef format_ndef;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_exception_handler exception_handler;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_is_ready is_ready;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_config config_llcp;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_check_llcp check_llcp_status;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_activate_llcp activate_llcp;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_create_socket create_llcp_socket;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_bind bind_llcp_socket;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_listen listen_llcp_socket;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_accept accept_llcp_socket;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_connect_by_url connect_llcp_by_url;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_connect connect_llcp;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_disconnect disconnect_llcp;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_socket_close close_llcp_socket;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_recv recv_llcp;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_send send_llcp;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_recv_from recv_from_llcp;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_send_to send_to_llcp;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_reject reject_llcp;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_get_remote_config get_remote_config;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_llcp_get_remote_socket_info get_remote_socket_info;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_sim_test sim_test;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_test_mode_on test_mode_on;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_test_mode_off test_mode_off;\n    net_nfc_oem_controller_support_nfc support_nfc;\n} net_nfc_oem_interface_s;\n\n\nThe nfc_oem_interface_s struct is exported in the nfc-plugin. Using this interface structure, the nfc-manager communicates with the OAL interfaces at runtime. The NFC plugin loads when the nfc-manager is started and the plugin init() function is called to initialize the NFC chip.\n\nint (*init) (net_nfc_oem_controller_init*);\n\n\nThe nfc-manager issues the deinit() function to deinitialize the NFC chip:\n\nint (*deinit) (net_nfc_oem_controller_deinit *);\n\n\nPay attention to the following:\n\n\n  Sending the notification to the upper layer (NFC service)\nSee the phdal4nfc_message_glib.c file. The g_idle_add_full is used for handling the message in the NFC service. You can use the callback client asynchronously in the client context. Post a message in queue, and the message is processed by a client thread.\n  Reference implementation of the NFC plugin\nSample code snippets cannot be reproduced. Code is proprietary.

The elm_box_pack_end() function is used to pack each button into the end of the box.\n\nExample: Box use case\n\n\n\nEvas_Object *win;\nEvas_Object *conf;\nEvas_Object *nf;\nEvas_Object *box;\nEvas_Object *btn;\nchar tmp[16];\nint i;\n\n/* Starting right after the basic EFL UI layout code */\n/* (win - conformant - naviframe) */\n\n/* Add a box and push it into the naviframe */\nbox = elm_box_add(nf);\nevas_object_show(box);\nelm_naviframe_item_push(nf, \"Box\", NULL, NULL, box, NULL);\n\nfor (i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {\n    btn = elm_button_add(box);\n    snprintf(tmp, sizeof(tmp), \"Button %d\", i);\n    elm_object_text_set(btn, tmp);\n\n    /* Set size hints for weight and align */\n    evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(btn, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n    evas_object_size_hint_align_set(btn, EVAS_HINT_FILL, 0.5);\n\n    evas_object_show(btn);\n    elm_box_pack_end(box, btn);\n}\n\n\nIn the above example, 2 functions are used to arrange buttons inside the box:\n\n\n  evas_object_size_hint_weight_set() sets a hint on how to resize a given child object within a container area.\n  evas_object_size_hint_align_set() sets a hint on how to align a child object inside the boundaries of a container.\n\n\nIf you change the weight or align hint value, the result changes.\n\nBox Layouts\n\nWhen building a box layout, you must use size hint functions to adjust the size and position of each element inside it:\n\n\n  Basically, an object contained in a box takes up space based on its minimum size.\n  If the sum of the objects’ minimum size is bigger than the size of the box parent, the box takes up all the space occupied by the parent, and the size of the parent may be extended to hold the box.\n  If the sum of the objects’ minimum size is smaller than the space given for the box, the objects are positioned at the center by default.\n\n\nYou can adjust the position of the image objects using the elm_box_align_set() function. The function takes 2 double values, a horizontal value and a vertical value, representing the percentage between 0.0 and 1.0 of the alignment in the horizontal and vertical axes. Remember that a box has a linear structure: the alignment only takes effect in the opposite direction than the one defined with the elm_box_horizontal_set() function.\n\nIn the following example, 2 images are packed into a box. The minimum size hints are set to the image objects with the elm_object_size_hint_min_set() function. Since the sum of the minimum size is smaller than the box area, which is equal to the window area in this case, the images are bound together and positioned at the center.\n\nTable: Various box layouts\n\n\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\n\n\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nelm_box_align_set(box, 0.5, 0.0);\n\n\n\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nelm_box_align_set(box, 0.5, 1.0);\n\n\n\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n\n\n\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(image, 0.0, 0.0);\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(image, 0.0, 0.0);\n\n\n\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(image, 1.0, 1.0);\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(image, 1.0, 1.0);\n\n\n\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(image, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(image, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);\n\n\n\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, 0.3);\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(image, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);\n\nimage = elm_image_add(box);\nelm_image_file_set(image, ICON_DIR\"/tizen.png\", NULL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(image, 200, 200);\nevas_object_show(image);\nelm_box_pack_end(box, image);\n\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(image, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, 0.7);\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(image, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);\n\n\n\n  Note\nExcept as noted, this content is licensed under LGPLv2.1+.\n\n\nRelated Information\n\n  Dependencies\n    \n      Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile\n      Tizen 2.3.1 and Higher for Wearable\n    \n  \n\n",

This means that all of the packages must be submitted with 1 unified identification, through a process known as group submission.\n\nThis feature is supported by the collaboration of the Tizen client development tool (GBS) and Tizen backend services.\n\nFor the platform developers, GBS provides the --tag &lt;TAG&gt; option, to accept a developer-specified “TAG” for the gbs submit command. All submissions for multiple packages with the same TAG are considered as a group, and packages in the same group are handled in the build system together.\n\nFor example, assume that “ail”, a low level library, depends on “aul”. “ail” developers have changed some APIs, and “aul” must be updated to adapt to the new API changes in “ail”. Therefore, once all related patches have been merged to “ail” and “aul” separately, these 2 packages must be submitted as a group:\n\n\n  \n    Submit 1 of the packages in the group to create a tag:\n\n    $ cd platform/core/appfw/aul-1/\n$ gbs submit -m \"&lt;Comments&gt;\"\n    \n  \n  \n    Obtain the tag name from the output of the above command, and use the same tag as a --tag parameter for other packages in the group:\n\n    $ cd platform/core/appfw/ail/\n$ gbs submit --tag &lt;same_tag&gt; -m \"&lt;Comments&gt;\"\n    \n  \n\n\nYou can also specify the tag yourself, and use the same tag for all packages in the package group. In this case, the tag must follow the usual tag format with an optional suffix:\n\nsubmit/$Tizen_Version/$(%Y%m%d.%H%M%S).N (N is a number you can choose freely)\n\n\nTizen backend services take care of all submissions with the same tag, and build them together.\n\nReviewing a Package on the Build Server\n\nIf you are a release engineer, you can review and accept changes on the build system side.\n\nAfter a developer runs the gbs submit command, the Tizen backend service starts the pre-release and normal release processes at the same time. During the pre-release process, packages and Tizen images with a specific package inside are presented to release engineers and Quality Assurance (QA) engineers for review.\n\nQA engineers are responsible for testing packages as isolated objects, as well as verifying Tizen images with a specific package inside to offer release engineers comprehensive information to make appropriate decision about whether to accept or reject a package, including the following:\n\n\n  Whether the package impacts other dependent package builds.\n  Whether the package brings in new bugs.\n  Whether the package causes regression issues.\n  Whether the package influences the performance of the Tizen image.\n\n\nAfter the packages are accepted by release engineers, the corresponding images are automatically created by the normal release process and can be obtained on http://download.tizen.org/releases/daily.\n",

            "content": "Device Compatibility\n\nTizen supports various mobile and wearable devices with different display sizes. For this, detailed style guidelines are provided to help you create consistently designed apps across different hardware platforms.\n\n\n\nFrom Small to Large, Increase Your Screen Real Estate\n\nConsider the smaller screen layout when you start planning your design. Larger screens allow for more content. While it does not make initial planning easier, larger screen sizes do provide more options. Options are limited with smaller screens, so you must be more decisive when choosing which features you will include. Once you decide on the key features or the number of icons to display on smaller devices, you can always enlarge and rearrange content to use on larger screens, increase the number of the icons to display, or add more features to provide more information taking advantage of the increased screen size.\n\nGo Smart with the Layout Design\n\nA flexible design is required to properly display your content on different screens. Use design techniques to allow your design to fit any screen nicely. Also, design screen layouts based on the most restrictive device to come up with a highly compatible screen layout.\n\nConsistent Design Language for All\n\nJust because your design should fit on different screens does not mean that the design must differ from one screen to another. On the contrary, it is a good idea to keep the design consistent and uniform so that they look alike regardless of the screen size. Keep the same UI components, color, look, and feel of the overall design to let people know that it is the same app throughout devices.\n",

            "content": "Emulator Extension Development Guide\n\nYou can develop various extensions for the emulator: QEMU, kernel, Emulator Manager, and Emulator Control Panel extensions.\n\nDeveloping QEMU Extensions\n\nTo develop a QEMU extension:\n\n\n  Develop your extension in a separate source directory.\nFor ease of management, you can use git submodule to handle the QEMU Git repository as a subdirectory.\n  Build the extension:\n    \n      Add your extension source code to a subdirectory under &lt;QEMU&gt;/tizen/src/.\n You can use git submodule to create the subdirectory from your source code directory, or link to it using a symbolic link.\n      Prepare the configure script.\n Use the existing emulator_configure.sh file in the &lt;QEMU&gt;/tizen/ directory as a template.\n      Run the configure script with the argument --extension-path = [extension directory], where the extension directory is a relative path starting from &lt;QEMU&gt;/tizen/src.\n      Run the make command with the &lt;QEMU&gt;/tizen/Makefile file.\n If you used git submodule to manage the QEMU repository as a subdirectory, it can be convenient to create a wrapper Makefile in the parent directory.\n    \n  \n  After you have built and tested your extension, push your code to the QEMU Git repository.\n\n\nDeveloping Kernel Extensions\n\nTo develop a kernel extension:\n\n\n  Develop your extension in a separate source directory.\nFor ease of management, you can use git submodule to handle the emulator-kernel Git repository as a subdirectory.\n  Build the extension:\n    \n      Add your extension source code to a subdirectory under &lt;emulator-kernel&gt;/drivers/maru/.\nYou can use git submodule to create the subdirectory from your source code directory, or link to it using a symbolic link.\n      Prepare the defconfig file.\nUse the existing defconfig file as a template.\nYou can use a script to set the extension path at build time, or if the extension path is fixed, it can be hardcoded in the defconfig file CONFIG_MARU_EXTENSION_SOURCE and CONFIG_MARU_EXTENSION_SOURCE_PATH variables.\n      Run the make command with the defconfig file.\nIf you used git submodule to manage the emulator-kernel repository as a subdirectory, it can be convenient to create a wrapper Makefile in the parent directory.\n    \n  \n  After you have built and tested your extension, push your code to the emulator-kernel Git repository.\n\n\nDeveloping Emulator Manager Extensions\n\nBefore developing Emulator Manager extensions, you must understand the structure of the Emulator Manager. The Emulator Manager has the following components:\n\n  em-lib.jar manages the common parts of the UI and CLI. It loads the plugin .jar file and the default property .xml file.\n  em-3.0-ui.jar contains the UI source, which is implemented using JavaFX. It loads the emulator UI template .xml file.\n  em-cli.jar contains the CLI source.\n\n\nFigure: Emulator Manager structure\n\n\n\nIn Emulator Manager plugins:\n\n  Each platform has separate files for its UI items and emulator options.\n  Each profile has a separate plugin.\nFor example:\n    \n      em-plugin-mobile.jar\n      em-plugin-wearable.jar\n    \n  \n  The template directory contains .xml files that define platform-specific UI and property values.\nFor example:\n    \n      X86-standard.xml (default property)\n      X86-standard-template-v2.xml (UI template)\n    \n  \n\n\nExtension points and their associated classes allow you to extend the features of the Emulator Manager:\n\n  The Item-Factory class extends property view items in the UI.\n    \n      Extension point: org.tizen.emulator.manager.ui.item.ViewItemFactory\n    \n  \n  The Option-Factory-v2 class extends launch options.\n    \n      Extension point: org.tizen.emulator.manager.vms.option.IOptionFactory\n    \n  \n  The Platform-Resource-Selector class selects whether to use platform resources.\n\n\nYou must specify the extension class in the MANIFEST.MF file of the plugin.\n\nFigure: Loading a plugin class\n\n\n\nThe following figure describes how extension plugins implement new features in the Emulator Manager.\n\nFigure: Implementing a plugin class\n\n\n\nFor example, you can create a UI extension to modify the launch options. This is implemented using the org.tizen.emulator.manager.vms.option.Option extension point. After creating a class instance, you can extend the OptionFactoryV2 class by using MakeOptionList to add a new option to the Common option list, or addOption to add a new option to a specific list item.\n\nDeveloping Emulator Control Panel Extensions\n\nThe Emulator Control Panel extensions use 2 Git repositories:\n\n  Lib, UI, and CLI code: sdk/emulator/emulator-control-panel\n  Device code: sdk/tools/emulator-control-panel-devices\n\n\nTo build an extension:\n\n\n  Copy the external binaries.\n  Copy the following binaries from tizen-sdk/tools/emulator/bin to the 2 libs folders in your project:\n    \n      args4j, jfxrt, jline, json-simple, and protobuf\n    \n  \n  Build the code:\n    \n      In the case of lib, ui, and cli libraries, to build them all at once, enter the ant shell command at the top level of your project.\n      In the case of devices:\n        \n          When building is complete, copy the built libecp, emulator-control-panel.jar, and emulator-control-panel-cli.jar files to libs in the devices project directory.\n          To build the mobile, wearable, and tv profiles all at once, enter the ant shell command at the top level of your project. To build a specific profile only, you can specify, for example, ant -f ECP-DEVICE/build_mobile.xml.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  If you configure devices separately, you only need to push changes to the emulator-control-panel-devices repository.\n  When building is complete, move the following files:\n    \n      libecp.jar, emulator-control-panel.jar, and emulator-control-panel-cli.jar to sdk/tools/emulator/bin\n      Device xml and jar files to platforms/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;profile&gt;/emulator-resources/plugins\n        \n          You must also rename the .jar and .xml files as ‘ecp-plugin--.'.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nTo execute the extension in Eclipse:\n\n\n  Launch the Eclipse IDE.\n  Import all the project files.\n  In the run configuration, set the main project and class.\n    \n      Project: ECP-UI for UI or ECP-CLI for CLI\n      Main class: org.tizen.ecp.EmulatorControlPanel for UI or org.tizen.cli.TizenEmulatorCli for CLI\n    \n  \n  In the run configuration, set the program arguments.\n    \n      vm_name: the name of vm instance\n      base_port: this can be found the first item from the context menu when you right click on an emulator. The port indicates the connected sdb port, so you should subtract 1 to get the base port.\n      platform_version: see below example\n      profile: see below example\nFor example:\n        vm_name=w-0906-1 base_port=26100 platform_version=tizen-2.3.2 profile=wearable\n        \n        The platform version and profile are used in the directory names:\n```\n      \n    \n    /platforms//\n```\n\n  \n  In the run configuration, add the ECP-DEVICES project into class path and source path.\n  In the run configuration, enter the following VM arguments. This is needed in order to change the search option to find the device xml and jar location. Basically, non-develop mode of ECP searches 3 above relative directory to find sdk.info. If it is develop mode, it searches current directory and the executable binary directory.\n    \n      -Ddevelop\n    \n  \n  Create a symbolic link on a terminal to set target directory of tizen studio. Tizen studio base location is used to find the target device xml and jar location, including extension version and profile location.\n    \n      sdk.info file is found based on the SDK installation path\n      For example: emulator-control-panel/ECP-LIB\n        \n          ln -s ~/tizen-studio/sdk.info sdk.info\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n",

            "content": "Creating Your First Tizen Wearable Native Watch Application\n\nWelcome to Tizen wearable native watch application development!\n\nA wearable native watch application is created using the C language, and can be run on Tizen wearable devices to display a customized watch face to the user.\n\nStudy the following instructions to help familiarize yourself with the Tizen native application development process as well as using the Tizen Studio and installing the created application on the emulator or target device. With the instructions, you can create and run a basic wearable native watch application, which displays some text and the current time on the screen:\n\n\n  \n    Before you get started with developing Tizen applications, download and install the Tizen Studio.\n\n    For more information on the installation process, see the installation guide.\n  \n  \n    Create a wearable native watch project using the Tizen Studio.\n\n    This step shows how you can use a predesigned project template that creates all the basic files and folders required for your project.\n  \n  \n    Build the application.\n\n    After you have implemented code for the features you want, this step shows how you can build the application to validate and compile the code.\n  \n  \n    Run the application.\n\n    This step shows how you can run the application on the emulator or a real target device.\n  \n  \n    Design a UI.\n\n    This step shows how you can create the application UI and make small alterations to it to improve the usability of your application.\n  \n\n\nWhen you are developing a more complex application, you can take advantage of the native tools included in the Tizen Studio to ease the tasks of creating functionality and designing the application UI.\n\n\nCreating a Project\n\nThe following example shows you how to create and configure a basic wearable native watch application project in the Tizen Studio. An application project contains all the files that make up an application.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the application to be created. The application screen displays the Hello Watch text and the current time, which continues to be refreshed every second while the application runs.\n\nFigure: Wearable native Watch application\n\n\n\nTo create the application project:\n\n\n  \n    Launch the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  \n    Make sure the Native perspective is selected in the upper-right corner of the Tizen Studio window.\n\n    \n\n    If not, select it. If the perspective is not visible, in the Tizen Studio menu, select Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other &gt; Native, and click OK.\n  \n  \n    In the Tizen Studio menu, select File &gt; New &gt; Tizen Project.\n\n    \n\n    The Project Wizard opens.\n  \n  \n    In the Project Wizard, define the project details.\n\n    The Project Wizard is used to create the basic application skeleton with the required folder structure and mandatory files. You can easily create different applications by selecting an applicable template or sample for the Project Wizard to use.\n\n    \n      \n        Select the Template project type and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the profile (Wearable) and version from a drop-down list and click Next.\n\n        The version depends on the platform version you have installed and with which you are developing the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the Native Application application type and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the Watch template and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Define the project properties and click Finish.\n\n        You can enter the project name (3-50 characters) and the unique package ID. You can also select the location and working sets by clicking More properties.\n\n        \n\n        The Project Wizard sets up the project, creates the application files using the default content from the template, and closes. For more information on the Project Wizard and the available templates, see Creating Tizen Projects with Tizen Project Wizard.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can see the created project in the Project Explorer view. The most important files and folders include:\n\n\n  \n    inc: Default folder for included source files\n  \n  \n    res: Folder for resource files used by the application only\n  \n  \n    shared: Folder for resource files to be shared with other applications\n  \n  \n    src: Folder for source code files\n  \n  \n    lib: Folder for external library files\n  \n  \n    tizen-manifest.xml: Manifest file used by the platform to install and launch the application\n  \n\n\nFigure: Application in the Project Explorer\n\n\n\n\n  Note\nYou can view and modify the application configuration in the manifest editor. In this example, no configuration changes are required.\n\n\nYour application project is now ready for further actions. Next, build the application.\n\n\nManaging the Application Configuration\n\nTo view and modify the application configuration:\n\n\n  \n    In the Project Explorer view, double-click the tizen-manifest.xml file of the application. The Tizen Studio opens the file in the manifest editor.\n  \n  \n    In the manifest editor, view and modify the configuration details using the various tabs:\n\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Overview: Define general information, such as the package, label, and icon of the application.\n      \n      \n        Features: Define required software and hardware features. This information is used for application filtering in the Tizen Store.\n      \n      \n        Privileges: Define the security-sensitive APIs or API groups accessed and used by the application.\n      \n      \n        Localization: Define localized values for the application label, description, and icon.\n      \n      \n        Advanced: Define advanced features, such as application metadata and some miscellaneous options.\n      \n      \n        Source: View and edit the source code of the tizen-manifest.xml file. Changes made and saved on the other tabs are reflected in the source code and vice versa.\n\n        \n          Note\nThe tizen-manifest.xml file must conform to both the XML file format and the Tizen native application specification requirements. Editing the file in the Source tab is intended for advanced users only.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    To save any changes, in the Tizen Studio menu, select File &gt; Save All.\n  \n\n\nFor more information on configuring the application, see Setting the Application Manifest.\n\nUnderstanding the Source Code\n\nPay attention to the following main issues in the application source code (in the inc/watch.h and src/watch.c files), to understand how the application is designed and how it works. For source code details related to the UI, see Designing a Simple UI.\n\n\n  \n    The watch application is initialized to use the functions and data types of the Watch Application API by including the &lt;watch_app.h&gt; header file in your application:\n\n    #include &lt;watch_app.h&gt;\n    \n\n    All header files that you need are already included in the watch.h file, which is generated by the Tizen Studio when the template project is created.\n  \n  \n    The life-cycle callbacks manage specific parts of the application life-cycle. They are set in the watch_app_lifecycle_callback_s structure, and the structure is passed to the watch_app_main() function of the Watch Application API to start the watch application event loop:\n\n      int\n  main(int argc, char *argv[])\n  {\n      appdata_s ad = {0,};\n      int ret = 0;\n\n      watch_app_lifecycle_callback_s event_callback = {0,};\n      app_event_handler_h handlers[5] = {NULL,};\n\n      event_callback.create = app_create;\n      event_callback.terminate = app_terminate;\n      event_callback.pause = app_pause;\n      event_callback.resume = app_resume;\n      event_callback.app_control = app_control;\n      event_callback.time_tick = app_time_tick;\n      event_callback.ambient_tick = app_ambient_tick;\n      event_callback.ambient_changed = app_ambient_changed;\n\n      ret = watch_app_main(argc, argv, &amp;event_callback, &amp;ad);\n      if (ret != APP_ERROR_NONE)\n          dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, \"watch_app_main() is failed. err = %d\", ret);\n\n      return ret;\n  }\n    \n\n    \n      \n        The create event is triggered before the application main loop starts. In this callback, you can initialize the application resources, such as create windows and data structures.\n\n        static bool\napp_create(int width, int height, void *data)\n{\n    /*\n       Hook to take necessary actions before the main event loop starts\n       Initialize UI resources and application's data\n       If this function returns true, the main loop of application starts\n       If this function returns false, the application is terminated\n    */\n    appdata_s *ad = data;\n\n    create_base_gui(ad, width, height);\n\n    return true;\n}\n        \n      \n      \n        The time_tick event is triggered at least once per second. The watch applications can get the current time from the watch_time time handle to draw a normal watch.\n\n          static void\n  app_time_tick(watch_time_h watch_time, void *data)\n  {\n      /* Called each second while your app is visible; update the watch UI */\n      appdata_s *ad = data;\n      update_watch(ad, watch_time, 0);\n  }\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      Note\nFor more information on the application life-cycle callbacks, see Applications.\n    \n  \n  \n    An ambient mode is available on a low-powered wearable device. In this mode, the watch application shows a limited UI and receives only the ambient tick event every minute to reduce power consumption.\n\n    The details of the limited UI drawn in the ambient mode depend on the device. In addition, due to the ambient mode being a low power mode, there are limits to the colors that can be shown on the screen. Usually, when designing the ambient mode UI, draw it with limited colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, red, green, blue, black and white), and use less than 15% of the pixels on the screen. If you do not want to draw your own ambient mode UI, set the ambient-support attribute to false in the watch application manifest file to allow the platform to show a default ambient mode UI.\n\n    \n      Note\n\n      To use the ambient mode, the user must enable it in the device settings. In addition, on the Gear S2 device, the ambient mode activates only when you are wearing the watch on the wrist.\n    \n\n    \n      \n        The ambient_tick callback is triggered every minute while the device is in the ambient mode. You can use the callback to update the time on your watch application in the ambient mode. In this callback, do not perform time-consuming tasks and always update the UI as quickly as possible. The platform can put the device to sleep shortly after the ambient tick expires.\n\n        static void\napp_ambient_tick(watch_time_h watch_time, void *data)\n{\n    /* Called at each minute while the device is in ambient mode. Update watch UI. */\n    appdata_s *ad = data;\n    update_watch(ad, watch_time, 1);\n}\n        \n      \n      \n        The ambient_changed callback is triggered when the ambient mode is enabled or disabled on the device. You can use the callback to initialize your ambient mode UI.\n\n          static void\n  app_ambient_changed(bool ambient_mode, void *data)\n  {\n      if (ambient_mode)\n          /* Prepare to enter the ambient mode */\n      else\n          /* Prepare to exit the ambient mode */\n  }\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nBuilding Your Application\n\nAfter you have created the application project, you can implement the required features. In this example, only the default features from the project template are used, and no code changes are required.\n\nWhen your application code is ready, you must build the application. The building process performs a validation check and compiles your files.\n\nYou can build the application in the following ways:\n\n\n  \n    Automatically\n\n    The automatic build means that the Tizen Studio automatically rebuilds the application whenever you change a source or resource file and save the application project.\n\n    To use the automatic build:\n\n    \n      Select the project in the Project Explorer view.\n      \n        In the Tizen Studio menu, select Project &gt; Build Automatically.\n\n        \n\n        A check mark appears next to the menu option.\n      \n    \n\n    You can toggle the automatic build on and off by reselecting Project &gt; Build Automatically.\n  \n  \n    Manually\n\n    The manual build means that you determine yourself when the application is built.\n\n    To manually build the application, right-click the project in the Project Explorer view and select Build Project.\n\n    Figure: Manually building the application\n\n    \n\n    Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n    \n      In the Tizen Studio menu, select Project &gt; Build Project.\n      Press the F10 key.\n    \n  \n\n\nYou can have more than one build configuration. To see the current active configuration or change it, right-click the project in the Project Explorer view and select Build Configurations &gt; Set Active. The default configuration is Debug. For more information, see Building Applications.\n\nAfter you have built the application, run it.\n\n\nRunning Your Application\n\nYou can run the application on the emulator or a real target device.\n\n\nRunning on the Emulator\n\nTo run the application on the emulator:\n\n\n  Launch an emulator instance in the Emulator Manager:\n    \n      \n        In the Tizen Studio menu, select Tools &gt; Emulator Manager.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        In the Emulator Manager, select a wearable emulator from the list and click Launch.\n\n        If no applicable emulator instance exists, create a new one.\n\n        \n\n        The emulator is launched in its own window. You can also see the new emulator instance and its folder structure in the Device Manager.\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Generate a security profile.\n\n    Before you run the application, you must sign your application package with a certificate profile in the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  Run the application:\n    \n      \n        In the Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Tizen Native Application.\n\n        \n\n        Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n        \n          Press the Ctrl + F11 key.\n          Click the run icon in the toolbar.\n        \n\n        If you have created multiple emulator instances, select the instance you want from the combo box in the toolbar before selecting to run the application. If you select an offline emulator, it is automatically launched when you select to run the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Confirm that the application launches on the emulator.\n\n        \n\n        \n          Note\nIf the emulator display has switched off, you cannot see the application launch. To switch the display on, click the Power key (in the lower-right corner of the emulator).\n        \n      \n      \n        Change the watch face.\n\n        To change the watch face and make the installed watch application visible:\n\n        \n\n        \n          If the emulator display has been switched off, activate it by pressing the Power key (in the lower-right corner of the emulator).\n          On the home screen (showing the default watch face), press the Power key.\n          In the Recent Apps screen, select Settings &gt; Watch faces and styles &gt; Watch faces.\n          \n            Swipe right until you find your application icon, and select it.\n\n            The Clock changed message is displayed.\n          \n          \n            Press the Back key (in the upper-right corner of the emulator device) multiple times, until the home screen with your new watch face is shown.\n\n            \n          \n        \n\n        While the application is running, the Log view in the Tizen Studio shows the log, debug, and exception messages from the methods defined in the log macros. To see the view, in the Tizen Studio menu, go to Window &gt; Show View &gt; Log.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nFor more information on using the emulator features, see Using Emulator Control Keys, Menu, and Panel and Using Extended Emulator Features.\n\n\nRunning on a Target Device\n\nTo run the application on a target device:\n\n\n  Connect the wearable target device to your computer:\n    \n      Define settings on the device:\n        \n          \n            Go to Settings &gt; Connections, and switch on Bluetooth.\n\n            \n\n            \n          \n          \n            Go to Settings &gt; Connections, and switch on Wi-Fi.\n\n            The device and the computer must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\n\n            Note the IP address the device is using.\n\n            \n          \n          \n            Go to Settings &gt; Gear info, and switch on the debugging mode.\n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        In the terminal, enter the following commands:\n\n         cd tizen-sdk/tools\n ./sdb connect &lt;IP address of Gear S2&gt;\n        \n\n        Use the IP address you noted before.\n\n        Instead of the terminal, you can also use the Remote Device Manager for the connection.\n      \n      \n        In the first attempt, the connection fails and the device asks for user confirmation. To allow Gear to read log data, copy files to and from your computer, and install the application manually, click the accept mark.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        In the Device Manager, confirm that the device is connected (shown in the device list).\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Generate an author certificate.\n\n    Before you run the application, you must sign your application package with a certificate profile in the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  Run the application:\n    \n      In the Device Manager, select the device.\n      \n        In Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Tizen Native Application.\n\n        \n\n        Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n        \n          Press the Ctrl + F11 key.\n          Click the run icon in the toolbar.\n        \n\n        If you have both a connected device and existing emulator instances, select the device from the combo box in the toolbar before selecting to run the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Confirm that the application launches on the target device.\n\n        Like with the emulator, you can change the watch face in the device settings to see the watch application on the home screen.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Note\nThe application is launched using the default debug run configuration. To create and use another configuration:\n      \n        In the Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Run Configurations.\n        In the Run Configurations window, click the New Launch Configuration icon (), define the configuration details, and launch the application by clicking Run.\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nDesigning a Simple UI\n\nThe wearable watch application created with the Watch template has a simple user interface with a label component showing the Hello Watch text and the current time (hour, minute, and second). The UI is created using EFL.\n\nIn the ambient mode, the Watch template UI is identical to the normal UI, except that is shows the current time without the seconds.\n\nFigure: User interface in the Watch template (ambient mode on the right)\n\n\n\nCreating the Basic UI\n\nThe UI in the Watch template contains the following components:\n\n\n  The EFL UI always contains a window component, which is the root component of the entire UI.\n  The application uses the conformant component as a container for other UI components.\n  The label showing the Hello Watch text and the current time is implemented with a label component.\n\n\nThe UI is created in the watch.c file:\n\n\n  \n    Data structure\n\n    A pointer to the UI components is stored in the appdata_s data structure:\n\n    struct appdata {\n    /* Window */\n    Evas_Object *win;\n    /* Conformant */\n    Evas_Object *conform;\n    /* Label */\n    Evas_Object *label;\n};\ntypedef struct appdata appdata_s;\n    \n  \n  \n    UI creation\n\n    The app_create() life-cycle callback is called when the application main loop starts, and it calls the create_base_gui() function to create the UI:\n\n     static bool\n app_create(int width, int height, void *data)\n {\n     /* Define system callbacks */\n\n     appdata_s *ad = data;\n\n     create_base_gui(ad, width, height);\n\n     return true;\n }\n    \n  \n  \n    UI components\n    \n      \n        The create_base_gui() function creates the UI components: window, conformant, and label.\n\n        The function receives a pointer to fill in the appdata_s structure.\n\n        static void\ncreate_base_gui(appdata_s *ad, int width, int height)\n{\n        \n      \n      \n        The window object of the idle screen is retrieved with the watch_app_get_elm_win() function of the Watch Application API.\n\n        The watch_time_h handle is created for managing the current time, and the evas_object_resize() function is used to resize the window to fit the screen.\n\n             int ret;\n     watch_time_h watch_time = NULL;\n\n     ret = watch_app_get_elm_win(&amp;ad-&gt;win);\n\n     if (ret != APP_ERROR_NONE) {\n         dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, \"failed to get window. err = %d\", ret);\n\n         return;\n     }\n\n     evas_object_resize(ad-&gt;win, width, height);\n        \n      \n      \n        The conformant component is used as a container for the other UI components:\n\n        \n          The component is the first object added inside the window with the elm_conformant_add() function.\n          The conformant component is set as a resize object of the window by using the elm_win_resize_object_add() function. It means that the conformant size and position are controlled by the window component directly.\n          The evas_object_show() function makes the conformant component visible.\n        \n\n             ad-&gt;conform = elm_conformant_add(ad-&gt;win);\n     evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;conform, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND,\n                                      EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n     elm_win_resize_object_add(ad-&gt;win, ad-&gt;conform);\n     evas_object_show(ad-&gt;conform);\n        \n      \n      \n        The label component for the text and time is added with the elm_label_add() function. The label is added inside the conformant component, which is the label’s parent.\n\n        The label is resized and moved so that it is located below the first third of the screen height.\n\n             ad-&gt;label = elm_label_add(ad-&gt;conform);\n     evas_object_resize(ad-&gt;label, width, height / 3);\n     evas_object_move(ad-&gt;label, 0, height / 3);\n     evas_object_show(ad-&gt;label);\n        \n      \n      \n        The watch_time_get_current_time() function retrieves the current time, and the update_watch() function uses the current time to set the label component content. Finally, the watch_time_h handle is deleted.\n\n             ret = watch_time_get_current_time(&amp;watch_time);\n\n     if (ret != APP_ERROR_NONE)\n         dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG,\n                    \"failed to get current time. err = %d\", ret);\n\n     update_watch(ad, watch_time, 0);\n     watch_time_delete(watch_time);\n        \n      \n      \n        When all the UI components are ready, the evas_object_show() function makes the window component visible. This means that the window displays everything on the screen at once.\n\n             evas_object_show(ad-&gt;win);\n }\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nModifying Existing Components\n\nWhen the basic UI exists, you can easily modify the components in the UI by using the component-specific functions, or more general Evas object functions.\n\nFor example, the following modification to the label component changes the text color to red:\n\n    ad-&gt;label = elm_label_add(ad-&gt;conform);\n    evas_object_color_set(ad-&gt;label, 255, 0, 0, 255);\n    evas_object_resize(ad-&gt;label, width, height / 3);\n    evas_object_move(ad-&gt;label, 0, height / 3);\n    evas_object_show(ad-&gt;label);\n\n\nFigure: Modified label component\n\n\n\nShowing the Current Time\n\nYou can update the time on the screen with the time_tick (in the normal mode) or ambient_tick (in the ambient mode) callback:\n\n\n  \n    Both callbacks contain the current time handle, and call the update_watch() function to update the label content on the screen:\n\n    static void\napp_time_tick(watch_time_h watch_time, void *data)\n{\n    appdata_s *ad = data;\n    update_watch(ad, watch_time, 0);\n}\n\nstatic void\napp_ambient_tick(watch_time_h watch_time, void *data)\n{\n    appdata_s *ad = data;\n    update_watch(ad, watch_time, 1);\n}\n    \n  \n  \n    In the update_watch() function, the watch_time_h handle is used to retrieve the current time elements (hour, minute, and second) with the watch_time_get_hour24(), watch_time_get_minute(), and watch_time_get_second() functions of the Watch Application API.\n\n    The text for the label component is defined (based on whether the normal or ambient mode is used), and set with the elm_object_text_set() function.\n\n     static bool\n update_watch(appdata_s *ad, watch_time_h watch_time, int ambient)\n {\n     char watch_text[TEXT_BUF_SIZE];\n     int hour24;\n     int minute;\n     int second;\n     if (watch_time == NULL)\n         return;\n\n     watch_time_get_hour24(watch_time, &amp;hour24);\n     watch_time_get_minute(watch_time, &amp;minute);\n     watch_time_get_second(watch_time, &amp;second);\n     if (!ambient) {\n         snprintf(watch_text, TEXT_BUF_SIZE,\n                  \"&lt;align=center&gt;Hello Watch&lt;br/&gt;%02d:%02d:%02d&lt;/align&gt;\",\n                  hour24, minute, second);\n     } else {\n         snprintf(watch_text, TEXT_BUF_SIZE,\n                  \"&lt;align=center&gt;Hello Watch&lt;br/&gt;%02d:%02d&lt;/align&gt;\",\n                  hour24, minute);\n     }\n\n     elm_object_text_set(ad-&gt;label, watch_text);\n }\n    \n  \n\n",

            "content": "Creating Your First Tizen Wearable Native Widget Application\n\nWelcome to Tizen wearable native widget application development!\n\nA wearable native widget application is created using the C language, and can be run on Tizen wearable devices. The application uses the native API, which provides various interfaces to the device hardware allowing you to take advantage of numerous capabilities tailored to run with limited device resources.\n\nA widget application is one of the Tizen application types. It can be shown by specific UI applications (such as the home screen and lock screen) that can contain widget applications.\n\nFigure: Widget application on a wearable device\n\n\n\nStudy the following instructions to help familiarize yourself with the Tizen native application development process as well as using the Tizen Studio and installing the created application on the emulator or target device. With the instructions, you can create and run a basic wearable native widget application, which displays some text on the screen with no user interaction:\n\n\n  \n    Before you get started with developing Tizen applications, download and install the Tizen Studio.\n\n    For more information on the installation process, see the installation guide.\n  \n  \n    Create a wearable native widget project using the Tizen Studio.\n\n    This step shows how you can use a predesigned project template that creates all the basic files and folders required for your project.\n  \n  \n    Build the application.\n\n    After you have implemented code for the features you want, this step shows how you can build the application to validate and compile the code.\n  \n  \n    Run the application.\n\n    This step shows how you can run the application on the emulator or a real target device.\n  \n  \n    Design a UI.\n\n    This step shows how you can create the application UI and make small alterations to it to improve the usability of your application.\n  \n\n\nWhen you are developing a more complex application, you can take advantage of the native tools included in the Tizen Studio to ease the tasks of creating functionality and designing the application UI.\n\n\nCreating a Project\n\nThe following example shows you how to create and configure a basic wearable native widget application project in the Tizen Studio. An application project contains all the files that make up an application.\n\n\n  Note\nStandalone widget application packages are not allowed in the Tizen Store.\nFor user convenience, you can use a standalone widget application for testing purposes in the Tizen Studio. If you want to publish the application in the Tizen Store, combine it with at least 1 UI application in the same package. For more information, see Developing Multiple Projects as a Combined Package.\n\n\nThe following figure illustrates the application to be created. The application screen displays the Hello widget text and no user interaction is provided.\n\nFigure: Wearable native Widget application\n\n\n\nTo create the application project:\n\n\n  \n    Launch the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  \n    Make sure the Native perspective is selected in the upper-right corner of the Tizen Studio window.\n\n    \n\n    If not, select it. If the perspective is not visible, in the Tizen Studio menu, select Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other &gt; Native, and click OK.\n  \n  \n    In the Tizen Studio menu, select File &gt; New &gt; Tizen Project.\n\n    \n\n    The Project Wizard opens.\n  \n  \n    In the Project Wizard, define the project details.\n\n    The Project Wizard is used to create the basic application skeleton with the required folder structure and mandatory files. You can easily create different applications by selecting an applicable template or sample for the Project Wizard to use.\n\n    \n      \n        Select the Template project type and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the profile (Wearable) and version from a drop-down list and click Next.\n\n        The version depends on the platform version you have installed and with which you are developing the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the Native Application application type and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the Widget template and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Define the project properties and click Finish.\n\n        You can enter the project name (3-50 characters) and the unique package ID. You can also select the location and working sets by clicking More properties.\n\n        \n\n        The Project Wizard sets up the project, creates the application files using the default content from the template, and closes. For more information on the Project Wizard and the available templates, see Creating Tizen Projects with Tizen Project Wizard.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can see the created project in the Project Explorer view. The most important files and folders include:\n\n\n  \n    inc: Default folder for included source files\n  \n  \n    res: Folder for resource files used by the application only\n  \n  \n    shared: Folder for resource files to be shared with other applications\n  \n  \n    src: Folder for source code files\n  \n  \n    lib: Folder for external library files\n  \n  \n    tizen-manifest.xml: Manifest file used by the platform to install and launch the application\n  \n\n\nFigure: Application in the Project Explorer\n\n\n\n\n  Note\nYou can view and modify the application configuration in the manifest editor. In this example, no configuration changes are required.\n\n\nYour application project is now ready for further actions. Next, build the application.\n\n\nManaging the Application Configuration\n\nTo view and modify the application configuration:\n\n\n  \n    In the Project Explorer view, double-click the tizen-manifest.xml file of the application. The Tizen Studio opens the file in the manifest editor.\n  \n  \n    In the manifest editor, view and modify the configuration details using the various tabs:\n\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Overview: Define general information, such as the package, label, and icon of the application.\n      \n      \n        Features: Define required software and hardware features. This information is used for application filtering in the Tizen Store.\n      \n      \n        Privileges: Define the security-sensitive APIs or API groups accessed and used by the application.\n      \n      \n        Localization: Define localized values for the application label, description, and icon.\n      \n      \n        Advanced: Define advanced features, such as application metadata, widget (preview image and supported size), and miscellaneous options.\n      \n      \n        Source: View and edit the source code of the tizen-manifest.xml file. Changes made and saved on the other tabs are reflected in the source code and vice versa.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Note\nThe tizen-manifest.xml file must conform to both the XML file format and the Tizen native application specification requirements. Editing the file in the Source tab is intended for advanced users only.\n    \n  \n  \n    To save any changes, in the Tizen Studio menu, select File &gt; Save All.\n  \n\n\nFor more information on configuring the application, see Setting the Application Manifest.\n\nUnderstanding the Source Code\n\nPay attention to the following main issues in the application source code (in the inc/widget.h and src/widget.c files), to understand how the application is designed and how it works. For source code details related to the UI, see Designing a Simple UI.\n\n\n  \n    The widget application is initialized to use the functions and data types of the Widget Application API by including the &lt;widget_app.h&gt; header file in your application:\n\n    #include &lt;widget_app.h&gt;\n    \n\n    All header files that you need are already included in the widget.h file, which is generated by the Tizen Studio when the template project is created.\n  \n  \n    The widget application life-cycle callbacks manage specific parts of the application life-cycle. They are set in the widget_app_lifecycle_callback_s structure, and the structure is passed to the widget_app_main() function of the Widget Application API to start the widget application event loop:\n\n    int\nmain(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    widget_app_lifecycle_callback_s ops = {0,};\n    int ret;\n\n    ops.create = widget_app_create;\n    ops.terminate = widget_app_terminate;\n\n    ret = widget_app_main(argc, argv, &amp;ops, NULL);\n    if (ret != WIDGET_ERROR_NONE)\n        dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, \"widget_app_main() failed. Err = %d\", ret);\n\n    return ret;\n}\n    \n\n    \n      \n        The create event is triggered before the application main loop starts. In this callback, you can initialize any resources that can be shared among widget instances. Register the widget instance callback functions, and create a widget instance class and return a handle for it, so that the handle can be used for making widget instances.\n\n        static widget_class_h\nwidget_app_create(void *user_data)\n{\n    /* Hook to take necessary actions before the main event loop starts */\n    widget_instance_lifecycle_callback_s ops = {NULL,};\n\n    return widget_app_class_create(ops, user_data);\n}\n        \n      \n      \n        The terminate event is triggered before the application ends. When you no longer need the widget application, use it to release the resources and terminate the application.\n\n        static void\nwidget_app_terminate(void *user_data)\n{\n    /* Release all resources */\n}\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    The widget application provides a life-cycle and functions for making and managing a widget class. The application has one process, whose responsibility it is to make a class in the widget_app_create() callback function of the Widget Application API. With this class, the framework can make instances whenever applications for widget viewers (such as home screen or lock screen) request for a widget instance.\n\n    The widget instance has its own life-cycle, which is similar to the widget application. However, the widget instance is simply an object that is shown by the applications for widget viewers. Many widget instances can be running on the same widget application process.\n\n    To manage the widget instance life-cycle, add the relevant callbacks to the widget_instance_lifecycle_callback_s structure during the widget application initialization:\n\n    static widget_class_h\nwidget_app_create(void *user_data)\n{\n    widget_instance_lifecycle_callback_s ops = {\n        .create = widget_instance_create,\n        .destroy = widget_instance_destroy,\n        .pause = widget_instance_pause,\n        .resume = widget_instance_resume,\n        .update = widget_instance_update,\n        .resize = widget_instance_resize,\n    };\n\n    return widget_app_class_create(ops, user_data);\n}\n    \n\n    \n      \n        The create callback is triggered when the widget instance is created. You can use the callback to initialize resources for the widget instance and draw the UI. If the bundle content is not NULL, restore the previous status.\n\n        static int\nwidget_instance_create(widget_context_h context, bundle *content,\n                       int w, int h, void *user_data)\n{\n    widget_instance_data_s *wid = (widget_instance_data_s*)\n                                  malloc(sizeof(widget_instance_data_s));\n    int ret;\n\n    if (content != NULL)\n        /* Recover the previous status with the bundle object */\n\n    /* Create the UI */\n\n    return WIDGET_ERROR_NONE;\n}\n        \n      \n      \n        The destroy callback is triggered when the widget instance is destroyed. You can use the callback to release all widget resources. If the reason for the termination is not WIDGET_APP_DESTROY_TYPE_PERMANENT, store the current status with the incoming bundle.\n\n        static int\nwidget_instance_destroy(widget_context_h context, widget_app_destroy_type_e reason,\n                        bundle *content, void *user_data)\n{\n    if (reason != WIDGET_APP_DESTROY_TYPE_PERMANENT)\n        /* Save the current status at the bundle object */\n\n    return WIDGET_ERROR_NONE;\n}\n        \n      \n      \n        The pause callback is triggered when the widget instance is paused. You can use the callback to take the necessary actions when the widget instance becomes invisible. The framework can destroy a paused widget instance.\n\n        static int\nwidget_instance_pause(widget_context_h context, void *user_data)\n{\n    return WIDGET_ERROR_NONE;\n}\n        \n      \n      \n        The resume callback is triggered when the widget instance is resumed. You can use the callback to take the necessary actions when the widget instance becomes visible.\n\n        static int\nwidget_instance_resume(widget_context_h context, void *user_data)\n{\n    return WIDGET_ERROR_NONE;\n}\n        \n      \n      \n        The update callback is triggered when a widget update event is received. You can use the callback to take the necessary actions for the widget update. If the force parameter is true, the widget can be updated even in the pause state.\n\n        static int\nwidget_instance_update(widget_context_h context, bundle *content, int force, void *user_data)\n{\n    return WIDGET_ERROR_NONE;\n}\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Widget instances can have private data. The data usually includes view objects to make a screen for each widget instance. The framework provides an easy way to find private data from the widget context handle, which is provided as a parameter in the callback functions. The following example shows how to make private data and use it:\n    \n      \n        You can define a private data structure and attach it to the widget instance by calling the widget_app_context_set_tag() function of the Widget Application API:\n\n        struct widget_instance_data {\n    Evas_Object *win;\n    Evas_Object *conform;\n    Evas_Object *label;\n};\ntypedef struct widget_instance_data widget_instance_data_s;\n\nstatic int\nwidget_instance_create(widget_context_h context, bundle *content,\n                       int w, int h, void *user_data)\n{\n    widget_instance_data_s *wid = (widget_instance_data_s*)\n                                  malloc(sizeof(widget_instance_data_s));\n\n    ret = widget_app_get_elm_win(context, &amp;wid-&gt;win);\n\n    wid-&gt;label = elm_label_add(wid-&gt;conform);\n\n    widget_app_context_set_tag(context, wid);\n}\n        \n      \n      \n        You can get the private data from the widget instance by calling the widget_app_context_get_tag() function of the Widget Application API.\n\n        The following code within the widget_instance_update() callback is not included in the default application template in the Tizen Studio, but you can add it to test the data handling feature.\n\n        static int\nwidget_instance_update(widget_context_h context, bundle *content,\n                       int force, void *user_data)\n{\n    widget_instance_data_s *wid = NULL;\n    widget_app_context_get_tag(context, (void**)&amp;wid);\n    if (wid-&gt;label)\n        elm_object_text_set(wid-&gt;label, \"Update Widget\");\n\n    return WIDGET_ERROR_NONE;\n}\n        \n      \n      \n        If you use private data, make sure that all the resources that you allocate are freed in the callback function for the widget instance destructor:\n\n        static int\nwidget_instance_destroy(widget_context_h context,\n                        widget_app_destroy_type_e reason, bundle *content, void *user_data)\n{\n    widget_instance_data_s *wid = NULL;\n    widget_app_context_get_tag(context, (void**)&amp;wid);\n\n    if (wid-&gt;win)\n        evas_object_del(wid-&gt;win);\n\n    free(wid);\n\n    return WIDGET_ERROR_NONE;\n}\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nBuilding Your Application\n\nAfter you have created the application project, you can implement the required features. In this example, only the default features from the project template are used, and no code changes are required.\n\nWhen your application code is ready, you must build the application. The building process performs a validation check and compiles your files.\n\nYou can build the application in the following ways:\n\n\n  \n    Automatically\n\n    The automatic build means that the Tizen Studio automatically rebuilds the application whenever you change a source or resource file and save the application project.\n\n    To use the automatic build:\n\n    \n      Select the project in the Project Explorer view.\n      \n        In the Tizen Studio menu, select Project &gt; Build Automatically.\n\n        \n\n        A check mark appears next to the menu option.\n      \n    \n\n    You can toggle the automatic build on and off by reselecting Project &gt; Build Automatically.\n  \n  \n    Manually\n\n    The manual build means that you determine yourself when the application is built.\n\n    To manually build the application, right-click the project in the Project Explorer view and select Build Project.\n\n    Figure: Manually building the application\n\n    \n\n    Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n    \n      In the Tizen Studio menu, select Project &gt; Build Project.\n      Press the F10 key.\n    \n  \n\n\nYou can have more than one build configuration. To see the current active configuration or change it, right-click the project in the Project Explorer view and select Build Configurations &gt; Set Active. The default configuration is Debug. For more information, see Building Applications.\n\nAfter you have built the application, run it.\n\n\nRunning Your Application\n\nYou can run the application on the emulator or a real target device.\n\n\nRunning on the Emulator\n\nTo run the application on the emulator:\n\n\n  Launch an emulator instance in the Emulator Manager:\n    \n      \n        In the Tizen Studio menu, select Tools &gt; Emulator Manager.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        In the Emulator Manager, select a wearable emulator from the list and click Launch.\n\n        If no applicable emulator instance exists, create a new one.\n\n        \n\n        The emulator is launched in its own window. You can also see the new emulator instance and its folder structure in the Device Manager.\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Generate a security profile.\n\n    Before you run the application, you must sign your application package with a certificate profile in the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  Run the application:\n    \n      \n        In the Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Tizen Native Application.\n\n        \n\n        Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n        \n          Press the Ctrl + F11 key.\n          Click the run icon in the toolbar.\n        \n\n        If you have created multiple emulator instances, select the instance you want from the combo box in the toolbar before selecting to run the application. If you select an offline emulator, it is automatically launched when you select to run the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Confirm that the application launches on the emulator.\n\n        \n\n        \n          Note\nIf the emulator display has switched off, you cannot see the application launch. To switch the display on, click the Power key (in the lower-right corner of the emulator).\n        \n\n        The above screen is shown through the Viewer, to allow you to develop a lone widget application for testing purposes.\n\n        To see the widget running on the home screen, add the widget there:\n\n        \n          Press the Back key (in the upper-right corner of the emulator device) to return to the home screen (showing a watch face).\n          Swipe the home screen right until you see + Add widget. Select it.\n          Swipe right until you see your widget application. Select it.\n        \n\n        \n\n        You can see the added widget on the home screen. To access the widget from the home screen, swipe right.\n\n        \n\n        While the application is running, the Log view in the Tizen Studio shows the log, debug, and exception messages from the methods defined in the log macros. To see the view, in the Tizen Studio menu, go to Window &gt; Show View &gt; Log.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nFor more information on using the emulator features, see Using Emulator Control Keys, Menu, and Panel and Using Extended Emulator Features.\n\n\nRunning on a Target Device\n\nTo run the application on a target device:\n\n\n  Connect the wearable target device to your computer:\n    \n      Define settings on the device:\n        \n          \n            Go to Settings &gt; Connections, and switch on Bluetooth.\n\n            \n\n            \n          \n          \n            Go to Settings &gt; Connections, and switch on Wi-Fi.\n\n            The device and the computer must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\n\n            Note the IP address the device is using.\n\n            \n          \n          \n            Go to Settings &gt; Gear info, and switch on the debugging mode.\n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        In the terminal, enter the following commands:\n\n        cd tizen-sdk/tools\n./sdb connect &lt;IP address of Gear S2&gt;\n        \n\n        Use the IP address you noted before.\n\n        Instead of the terminal, you can also use the Remote Device Manager for the connection.\n      \n      \n        In the first attempt, the connection fails and the device asks for user confirmation. To allow Gear to read log data, copy files to and from your computer, and install the application manually, click the accept mark.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        In the Device Manager, confirm that the device is connected (shown in the device list).\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Generate an author certificate.\n\n    Before you run the application, you must sign your application package with a certificate profile in the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  Run the application:\n    \n      In the Device Manager, select the device.\n      \n        In Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Tizen Native Application.\n\n        \n\n        Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n        \n          Press the Ctrl + F11 key.\n          Click the run icon in the toolbar.\n        \n\n        If you have both a connected device and existing emulator instances, select the device from the combo box in the toolbar before selecting to run the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Confirm that the application launches on the target device.\n\n        Like with the emulator, you can add the widget to the home screen to easily access it.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Note\nThe application is launched using the default debug run configuration. To create and use another configuration:\n      \n        In the Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Run Configurations.\n        In the Run Configurations window, click the New Launch Configuration icon (), define the configuration details, and launch the application by clicking Run.\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nDesigning a Simple UI\n\nThe wearable widget application created with the Widget template has a simple user interface with a label component showing the Hello widget text. The UI is created using EFL.\n\nFigure: User interface in the Widget template\n\n\n\nCreating the Basic UI\n\nThe UI in the Widget template contains the following components:\n\n\n  The EFL UI always contains a window component, which is the root component of the entire UI.\n  The application uses the conformant component as a container for other UI components.\n  The label showing the Hello widget text is implemented with a label component.\n\n\nThe UI is created in the widget.c file:\n\n\n  \n    Data structure\n\n    A pointer to the UI components is stored in the widget_instance_data_s data structure:\n\n    #include &lt;widget_app_efl.h&gt;\n\nstruct widget_instance_data {\n    /* Window */\n    Evas_Object *win;\n    /* Conformant */\n    Evas_Object *conform;\n    /* Label */\n    Evas_Object *label;\n};\ntypedef struct widget_instance_data widget_instance_data_s;\n    \n  \n  \n    UI creation\n\n    The widget_app_create() life-cycle callback is called when the application main loop starts. It registers the widget_instance_create() callback, which creates the UI when the widget instance starts.\n\n    static widget_class_h\nwidget_app_create(void *user_data)\n{\n    /* Register system event handlers */\n\n    widget_instance_lifecycle_callback_s ops =\n    {\n        .create = widget_instance_create,\n        .destroy = widget_instance_destroy,\n        .pause = widget_instance_pause,\n        .resume = widget_instance_resume,\n        .update = widget_instance_update,\n    };\n\n    return widget_app_class_create(ops, user_data);\n}\n    \n  \n  \n    UI components\n    \n      \n        The widget_instance_create() function creates the UI components: window, conformant, and label.\n\n        The function defines a pointer to fill in the widget_instance_data_s structure.\n\n        static int\nwidget_instance_create(widget_context_h context, bundle *content,\n                       int w, int h, void *user_data)\n{\n    widget_instance_data_s *wid = (widget_instance_data_s*)\n                                  malloc(sizeof(widget_instance_data_s));\n\n    int ret;\n    if (content != NULL)\n        /* Recover the previous status with the bundle object */\n        \n      \n      \n        The window object for the widget is retrieved with the widget_app_get_elm_win() function of the Widget Application API to create the UI on the home screen.\n\n        The evas_object_resize() function is used to resize the window to fit the screen.\n\n            /* Window */\n    ret = widget_app_get_elm_win(context, &amp;wid-&gt;win);\n    if (ret != WIDGET_ERROR_NONE) {\n        dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, \"failed to get window. err = %d\", ret);\n\n        return WIDGET_ERROR_FAULT;\n    }\n\n    evas_object_resize(wid-&gt;win, w, h);\n        \n      \n      \n        The conformant component is used as a container for the other UI components:\n\n        \n          The component is the first object added inside the window with the elm_conformant_add() function.\n          The conformant component is set as a resize object of the window by using the elm_win_resize_object_add() function. It means that the conformant size and position are controlled by the window component directly.\n          The evas_object_show() function makes the conformant component visible.\n        \n\n            /* Conformant */\n    wid-&gt;conform = elm_conformant_add(wid-&gt;win);\n    evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(wid-&gt;conform, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND,\n                                     EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n    elm_win_resize_object_add(wid-&gt;win, wid-&gt;conform);\n    evas_object_show(wid-&gt;conform);\n        \n      \n      \n        The label component for the text is added with the elm_label_add() function. The label is added inside the conformant component, which is the label’s parent.\n\n        The label is resized and moved, and its text is set with the elm_object_text_set() function.\n\n            /* Label */\n    wid-&gt;label = elm_label_add(wid-&gt;conform);\n    evas_object_resize(wid-&gt;label, w, h / 3);\n    evas_object_move(wid-&gt;label, w / 4, h / 3);\n    evas_object_show(wid-&gt;label);\n    elm_object_text_set(wid-&gt;label, \"&lt;align=center&gt;Hello widget&lt;/align&gt;\");\n        \n      \n      \n        When all the UI components are ready, the evas_object_show() function makes the window component visible. This means that the window displays everything on the screen at once.\n\n            /* Show the window after the base GUI is set up */\n    evas_object_show(wid-&gt;win);\n\n    widget_app_context_set_tag(context, wid);\n\n    return WIDGET_ERROR_NONE;\n}\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nModifying Existing Components\n\nWhen the basic UI exists, you can easily modify the components in the UI by using the component-specific functions, or more general Evas object functions.\n\nFor example, the following modification to the label component changes the text color to green:\n\n/* Label */\nwid-&gt;label = elm_label_add(wid-&gt;conform);\nevas_object_resize(wid-&gt;label, w, h / 3);\nevas_object_move(wid-&gt;label, w / 4, h / 3);\nevas_object_color_set(wid-&gt;label, 50, 255, 150, 255);\nevas_object_show(wid-&gt;label);\nelm_object_text_set(wid-&gt;label, \"&lt;align=center&gt;Hello widget&lt;/align&gt;\");\n\n\nFigure: Modified label component\n\n\n",

            "content": "Creating Your First Tizen Wearable Native Application\n\nWelcome to Tizen wearable native application development!\n\nA wearable native application is created using the C language, and can be run on Tizen wearable devices. The application uses the native API, which provides various interfaces to the device hardware allowing you to take advantage of numerous capabilities tailored to run with limited device resources.\n\nStudy the following instructions to help familiarize yourself with the Tizen native application development process as well as using the Tizen Studio and installing the created application on the emulator or target device. With the instructions, you can create and run a basic wearable native application, which displays some text on the screen with no user interaction:\n\n\n  \n    Before you get started with developing Tizen applications, download and install the Tizen Studio.\n\n    For more information on the installation process, see the installation guide.\n  \n  \n    Create a wearable native project using the Tizen Studio.\n\n    This step shows how you can use a predesigned project template that creates all the basic files and folders required for your project.\n  \n  \n    Build the application.\n\n    After you have implemented code for the features you want, this step shows how you can build the application to validate and compile the code.\n  \n  \n    Run the application.\n\n    This step shows how you can run the application on the emulator or a real target device.\n  \n  \n    Design a UI.\n\n    This step shows how you can create the application UI and make small alterations to it to improve the usability of your application.\n  \n\n\nWhen you are developing a more complex application, you can take advantage of the native tools included in the Tizen Studio to ease the tasks of creating functionality and designing the application UI.\n\n\nCreating a Project\n\nThe following example shows you how to create and configure a basic wearable native application project in the Tizen Studio. An application project contains all the files that make up an application.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the application to be created. The application screen displays the Hello Tizen text and no user interaction is provided. If you click the Back key on the device, the application moves to the background.\n\nFigure: Wearable native Basic UI application\n\n\n\nTo create the application project:\n\n\n  \n    Launch the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  \n    Make sure the Native perspective is selected in the upper-right corner of the Tizen Studio window.\n\n    \n\n    If not, select it. If the perspective is not visible, in the Tizen Studio menu, select Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other &gt; Native, and click OK.\n  \n  \n    In the Tizen Studio menu, select File &gt; New &gt; Tizen Project.\n\n    \n\n    The Project Wizard opens.\n  \n  \n    In the Project Wizard, define the project details.\n\n    The Project Wizard is used to create the basic application skeleton with the required folder structure and mandatory files. You can easily create different applications by selecting an applicable template or sample for the Project Wizard to use.\n\n    \n      \n        Select the Template project type and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the profile (Wearable) and version from a drop-down list and click Next.\n\n        The version depends on the platform version you have installed and with which you are developing the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the Native Application application type and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the Basic UI template and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Define the project properties and click Finish.\n\n        You can enter the project name (3-50 characters) and the unique package ID. You can also select the location and working sets by clicking More properties.\n\n        \n\n        The Project Wizard sets up the project, creates the application files using the default content from the template, and closes. For more information on the Project Wizard and the available templates, see Creating Tizen Projects with Tizen Project Wizard.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can see the created project in the Project Explorer view. The most important files and folders include:\n\n\n  \n    inc: Default folder for included source files\n  \n  \n    res: Folder for resource files used by the application only\n  \n  \n    shared: Folder for resource files to be shared with other applications\n  \n  \n    src: Folder for source code files\n  \n  \n    lib: Folder for external library files\n  \n  \n    tizen-manifest.xml: Manifest file used by the platform to install and launch the application\n  \n\n\nFigure: Application in the Project Explorer\n\n\n\n\n  Note\nYou can view and modify the application configuration in the manifest editor. In this example, no configuration changes are required.\n\n\nYour application project is now ready for further actions. Next, build the application.\n\n\nManaging the Application Configuration\n\nTo view and modify the application configuration:\n\n\n  \n    In the Project Explorer view, double-click the tizen-manifest.xml file of the application. The Tizen Studio opens the file in the manifest editor.\n  \n  \n    In the manifest editor, view and modify the configuration details using the various tabs:\n\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Overview: Define general information, such as the package, label, and icon of the application.\n      \n      \n        Features: Define required software and hardware features. This information is used for application filtering in the Tizen Store.\n      \n      \n        Privileges: Define the security-sensitive APIs or API groups accessed and used by the application.\n      \n      \n        Localization: Define localized values for the application label, description, and icon.\n      \n      \n        Advanced: Define advanced features, such as application metadata, data control for services, application control functionalities, and account details.\n      \n      \n        Source: View and edit the source code of the tizen-manifest.xml file. Changes made and saved on the other tabs are reflected in the source code and vice versa.\n\n        \n          Note\nThe tizen-manifest.xml file must conform to both the XML file format and the Tizen native application specification requirements. Editing the file in the Source tab is intended for advanced users only.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    To save any changes, in the Tizen Studio menu, select File &gt; Save All.\n  \n\n\nFor more information on configuring the application, see Setting the Application Manifest.\n\nUnderstanding the Source Code\n\nPay attention to the life-cycle callbacks in the application source code, to understand how the application works. For source code details related to the UI, see Designing a Simple UI.\n\nThe main() function in the src/basicui.c file is used to register callbacks that manage specific parts of the application life-cycle:\n\n\n  app_create\n    \n      Called when the application process starts.\n      Used to create UI components.\n    \n  \n  app_terminate\n    \n      Called while the application process is terminating.\n      Called after the main loop quits.\n    \n  \n  app_resume (UI applications only)\n    \n      Called when the application window is shown.\n    \n  \n  app_pause (UI applications only)\n    \n      Called when the application window is totally hidden.\n    \n  \n  app_control\n    \n      Called after the app_create callback when the process starts.\n      Called when a launch request is received while the process is running.\n      Can receive app_control data (parameters for launching the application).\n      Used to implement parameter-specific actions of the application.\n    \n  \n\n\nint\nmain(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    appdata_s ad = {0,};\n    int ret = 0;\n\n    ui_app_lifecycle_callback_s event_callback = {0,};\n    app_event_handler_h handlers[5] = {NULL,};\n\n    event_callback.create = app_create;\n    event_callback.terminate = app_terminate;\n    event_callback.pause = app_pause;\n    event_callback.resume = app_resume;\n    event_callback.app_control = app_control;\n\n    ret = ui_app_main(argc, argv, &amp;event_callback, &amp;ad);\n    if (ret != APP_ERROR_NONE)\n        dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, \"app_main() failed. Err = %d\", ret);\n\n    return ret;\n}\n\n\n\nBuilding Your Application\n\nAfter you have created the application project, you can implement the required features. In this example, only the default features from the project template are used, and no code changes are required.\n\nWhen your application code is ready, you must build the application. The building process performs a validation check and compiles your files.\n\nYou can build the application in the following ways:\n\n\n  \n    Automatically\n\n    The automatic build means that the Tizen Studio automatically rebuilds the application whenever you change a source or resource file and save the application project.\n\n    To use the automatic build:\n\n    \n      Select the project in the Project Explorer view.\n      \n        In the Tizen Studio menu, select Project &gt; Build Automatically.\n\n        \n\n        A check mark appears next to the menu option.\n      \n    \n\n    You can toggle the automatic build on and off by reselecting Project &gt; Build Automatically.\n  \n  \n    Manually\n\n    The manual build means that you determine yourself when the application is built.\n\n    To manually build the application, right-click the project in the Project Explorer view and select Build Project.\n\n    Figure: Manually building the application\n\n    \n\n    Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n    \n      In the Tizen Studio menu, select Project &gt; Build Project.\n      Press the F10 key.\n    \n  \n\n\nYou can have more than one build configuration. To see the current active configuration or change it, right-click the project in the Project Explorer view and select Build Configurations &gt; Set Active. The default configuration is Debug. For more information, see Building Applications.\n\nAfter you have built the application, run it.\n\n\nRunning Your Application\n\nYou can run the application on the emulator or a real target device.\n\n\nRunning on the Emulator\n\nTo run the application on the emulator:\n\n\n  Launch an emulator instance in the Emulator Manager:\n    \n      \n        In the Tizen Studio menu, select Tools &gt; Emulator Manager.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        In the Emulator Manager, select a wearable emulator from the list and click Launch.\n\n        If no applicable emulator instance exists, create a new one.\n\n        \n\n        The emulator is launched in its own window. You can also see the new emulator instance and its folder structure in the Device Manager.\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Generate a security profile.\n\n    Before you run the application, you must sign your application package with a certificate profile in the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  Run the application:\n    \n      \n        In the Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Tizen Native Application.\n\n        \n\n        Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n        \n          Press the Ctrl + F11 key.\n          Click the run icon in the toolbar.\n        \n\n        If you have created multiple emulator instances, select the instance you want from the combo box in the toolbar before selecting to run the application. If you select an offline emulator, it is automatically launched when you select to run the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Confirm that the application launches on the emulator.\n\n        \n\n        \n          Note\nIf the emulator display has switched off, you cannot see the application launch. To switch the display on, click the Power key (in the lower-right corner of the emulator).\n        \n\n        While the application is running, the Log view in the Tizen Studio shows the log, debug, and exception messages from the methods defined in the log macros. To see the view, in the Tizen Studio menu, go to Window &gt; Show View &gt; Log.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nFor more information on using the emulator features, see Using Emulator Control Keys, Menu, and Panel and Using Extended Emulator Features.\n\n\nRunning on a Target Device\n\nTo run the application on a target device:\n\n\n  Connect the wearable target device to your computer:\n    \n      Define settings on the device:\n        \n          \n            Go to Settings &gt; Connections, and switch on Bluetooth.\n\n            \n\n            \n          \n          \n            Go to Settings &gt; Connections, and switch on Wi-Fi.\n\n            The device and the computer must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\n\n            Note the IP address the device is using.\n\n            \n          \n          \n            Go to Settings &gt; Gear info, and switch on the debugging mode.\n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      Use the Remote Device Manager to connect the wearable device:\n        \n          \n            In the Device Manager, launch the Remote Device Manager by clicking the related icon.\n\n            \n          \n          \n            In the Remote Device Manager window, click +.\n\n            \n          \n          \n            In the Add Device window, enter the device and network details (use the IP address you noted before), and click Add.\n\n            \n          \n          \n            In the Remote Device Manager window, switch the new device on by clicking the switch under Connect.\n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        The device asks for user confirmation. To allow Gear to read log data, copy files to and from your computer, and install the application manually, click the accept mark.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        In the Device Manager, confirm that the device is connected (shown in the device list).\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Generate an author certificate.\n\n    Before you run the application, you must sign your application package with a certificate profile in the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  Run the application:\n    \n      In the Device Manager, select the device.\n      \n        In Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Tizen Native Application.\n\n        \n\n        Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n        \n          Press the Ctrl + F11 key.\n          Click the run icon in the toolbar.\n        \n\n        If you have both a connected device and existing emulator instances, select the device from the combo box in the toolbar before selecting to run the application.\n\n        \n      \n    \n\n    c.  Confirm that the application launches on the target device.\n\n    \n      Note\nThe application is launched using the default debug run configuration. To create and use another configuration:\n      \n        In the Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Run Configurations.\n        In the Run Configurations window, click the New Launch Configuration icon (), define the configuration details, and launch the application by clicking Run.\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nDesigning a Simple UI\n\nThe wearable application created with the Basic UI template has a simple user interface with a label component showing the Hello Tizen text at the top of the screen. The UI is created using EFL.\n\nFigure: User interface in the Basic UI template\n\n\n\nCreating the Basic UI\n\nThe UI in the Basic UI template contains the following components:\n\n\n  The EFL UI always contains a window component, which is the root component of the entire UI.\n  Since the application has the indicator bar at the top of the screen, it requires the conformant component.\n  The text label is implemented with a label component.\n\n\nThe UI is created in the basicui.c file:\n\n\n  \n    Data structure\n\n    A pointer to the UI components is stored in the appdata_s data structure:\n\n    struct appdata {\n    /* Window */\n    Evas_Object *win;\n    /* Conformant */\n    Evas_Object *conform;\n    /* Label */\n    Evas_Object *label;\n};\ntypedef struct appdata appdata_s;\n    \n  \n  \n    UI creation\n\n    The app_create() life-cycle callback is called when the application main loop starts, and it calls the create_base_gui() function to create the UI:\n\n    static bool\napp_create(void *data)\n{\n    /*\n       Hook to take necessary actions before the main event loop starts\n       Initialize UI resources and application data\n       If this function returns true, the application main loop starts\n       If this function returns false, the application is terminated\n    */\n    appdata_s *ad = data;\n\n    create_base_gui(ad);\n\n    return true;\n}\n    \n  \n  \n    UI components\n    \n      \n        The create_base_gui() function creates the UI components: window, conformant, and label.\n\n        The function receives a pointer to fill in the appdata_s structure.\n\n        static void\ncreate_base_gui(appdata_s *ad)\n{\n        \n      \n      \n        The window component is created with the elm_win_util_standard_add() function.\n\n        Callbacks are also added for the window: one of the callbacks handles the delete,request event when the window is to be closed, and the other handles the EEXT_CALLBACK_BACK event when the hardware Back key is pressed.\n\n            /*\n       Window\n       Create and initialize elm_win, which is mandatory to manipulate a window\n    */\n    ad-&gt;win = elm_win_util_standard_add(PACKAGE, PACKAGE);\n    elm_win_autodel_set(ad-&gt;win, EINA_TRUE);\n\n    if (elm_win_wm_rotation_supported_get(ad-&gt;win)) {\n        int rots[4] = {0, 90, 180, 270};\n        elm_win_wm_rotation_available_rotations_set(ad-&gt;win, (const int *)(&amp;rots), 4);\n    }\n    evas_object_smart_callback_add(ad-&gt;win, \"delete,request\", win_delete_request_cb, NULL);\n    eext_object_event_callback_add(ad-&gt;win, EEXT_CALLBACK_BACK, win_back_cb, ad);\n        \n      \n      \n        The conformant component is needed to show the indicator bar at the top of the screen:\n\n        \n          The component is the first object added inside the window with the elm_conformant_add() function.\n          The elm_win_indicator_mode_set() function decides whether the indicator is visible, and the elm_win_indicator_opacity_set() function sets the indicator opacity mode.\n          The conformant component is set as a resize object of the window by using the elm_win_resize_object_add() function. It means that the conformant size and position are controlled by the window component directly.\n          The evas_object_show() function makes the conformant component visible.\n        \n\n            /*\n       Conformant\n       Create and initialize elm_conformant, which is mandatory for the base GUI\n       to have a proper size when an indicator or virtual keypad is visible\n    */\n    ad-&gt;conform = elm_conformant_add(ad-&gt;win);\n    elm_win_indicator_mode_set(ad-&gt;win, ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_SHOW);\n    elm_win_indicator_opacity_set(ad-&gt;win, ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_OPAQUE);\n    evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;conform, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND,\n                                     EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n    elm_win_resize_object_add(ad-&gt;win, ad-&gt;conform);\n    evas_object_show(ad-&gt;conform);\n        \n      \n      \n        The label component for the text is added with the elm_label_add() function. The label is added inside the conformant component, which is the label’s parent.\n\n        The label text is set with the elm_object_text_set() function.\n\n            /*\n       Label\n       Create an actual view of the base GUI\n       Modify this part to change the view\n    */\n    ad-&gt;label = elm_label_add(ad-&gt;conform);\n    elm_object_text_set(ad-&gt;label, \"&lt;align=center&gt;Hello Tizen&lt;/align&gt;\");\n    evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;label, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND,\n                                     EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n    elm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;label);\n        \n      \n      \n        When all the UI components are ready, the evas_object_show() function makes the window component visible. This means that the window displays everything on the screen at once.\n\n            /* Show the window after the base GUI is set up */\n    evas_object_show(ad-&gt;win);\n}\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nModifying Existing Components\n\nWhen the basic UI exists, you can easily modify the components in the UI by using the component-specific functions, or more general Evas object functions.\n\nFor example, the following modifications to the label component change the label style to a marker (making the text bold) and increase the font size to 50:\n\n/* Label */\nad-&gt;label = elm_label_add(ad-&gt;conform);\nelm_object_text_set(ad-&gt;label, \"&lt;align=center&gt;&lt;font_size=50&gt;Hello Tizen&lt;/font/&gt;&lt;/align&gt;\");\nelm_object_style_set(ad-&gt;label, \"marker\");\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;label, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nelm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;label);\n\n\nFigure: Modified label component\n\n\n\nAdding More Components and Functionality\n\nThe basic UI only contains one visible label component. You can use it as a basis to design a more elaborate UI with more components, screens, and functionality. The following example shows how to add a list to the existing view (screen), and how to create a second view and move between the 2 views.\n\nAll the code changes in this section are made within the create_base_gui() function, unless stated otherwise.\n\nTo add more content to the UI:\n\n\n  \n    Modify the existing label view to contain a list too.\n\n    To add more components, first create a container that can hold all the various components in one view.\n\n    In this example, the box container is used. It is created and added to the conformant. The new list is created, and then the new list and the existing label component are both added to the box.\n\n    \n      \n        Add the box and list objects to the appdata_s data structure:\n\n        struct appdata {\n    Evas_Object *win;\n    Evas_Object *conform;\n    Evas_Object *label;\n    /* Box */\n    Evas_Object *box;\n    /* List */\n    Evas_Object *list;\n};\ntypedef struct appdata appdata_s;\n        \n      \n      \n        Create the box component using the conformant as the parent, and set the box as the conformant content:\n\n        ad-&gt;box = elm_box_add(ad-&gt;conform);\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;box, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nevas_object_show(ad-&gt;box);\nelm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;box);\n        \n      \n      \n        Modify the existing label component to use box as a parent, and add it to the box:\n\n        /* Modify the label code */\nad-&gt;label = elm_label_add(ad-&gt;box);\nelm_object_text_set(ad-&gt;label, \"&lt;align=center&gt;Hello Tizen&lt;/align&gt;\");\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;label, 0.0, 0.0);\n/* Comment out the elm_object_content_set() function */\n/* elm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;label); */\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(ad-&gt;label, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);\nevas_object_size_hint_min_set(ad-&gt;label, 50, 50);\n/* Show and add to box */\nevas_object_show(ad-&gt;label);\nelm_box_pack_end(ad-&gt;box, ad-&gt;label);\n        \n      \n      \n        Create the list and add it to the box:\n\n        \n          \n            Create a list component with the elm_list_add() function.\n\n            The box component is the parent of the new list component.\n          \n          \n            Add items to the list with the elm_list_item_append() function.\n          \n        \n\n        int i;\n/* Create the list */\nad-&gt;list = elm_list_add(ad-&gt;box);\n/* Set the list size */\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;list, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nevas_object_size_hint_align_set(ad-&gt;list, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);\n\nfor (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {\n    char tmp[8];\n    snprintf(tmp, sizeof(tmp), \"Item %d\", i + 1);\n    /* Add an item to the list */\n    elm_list_item_append(ad-&gt;list, tmp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);\n}\n/* Show and add to box */\nevas_object_show(ad-&gt;list);\nelm_box_pack_end(ad-&gt;box, ad-&gt;list);\n        \n      \n    \n\n    When you run the application, the screen now shows the label at the top and the list in the middle.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Create another view and navigate between the views.\n\n    The previous step created a view that contained a box component with a list component in the box. To create an application with multiple views, you need to add a naviframe component to the application.\n\n    \n      \n        Add the naviframe and naviframe item objects to the appdata_s data structure:\n\n        struct appdata {\n    Evas_Object *win;\n    Evas_Object *conform;\n    Evas_Object *label;\n    Evas_Object *box;\n    Evas_Object *list;\n    /* Naviframe */\n    Evas_Object *navi;\n    /* Item */\n    Elm_Object_Item *navi_item;\n};\ntypedef struct appdata appdata_s;\n        \n      \n      \n        Create the naviframe using the conformant as the parent:\n\n        ad-&gt;navi = elm_naviframe_add(ad-&gt;conform);\nevas_object_show(ad-&gt;navi);\nelm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;navi);\n        \n      \n      \n        Modify the box component to have the naviframe as a parent:\n\n        ad-&gt;box = elm_box_add(ad-&gt;navi);\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;box, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nevas_object_show(ad-&gt;box);\nelm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;navi, ad-&gt;box);\n        \n      \n      \n        Push the box to the naviframe as a top item to create the first view. The second parameter defines a title text for the view.\n\n        Each application view is a separate item in the naviframe, and the top item is always displayed.\n\n        ad-&gt;navi_item = elm_naviframe_item_push(ad-&gt;navi, \"First view\", NULL,\n                                        NULL, ad-&gt;box, NULL);\n        \n      \n      \n        Create the navigation between the views by adding a clicked,double event callback to the list. When the user double-clicks the item, the second view opens.\n\n        For clarity, change the first list item text to Go to Second.\n\n        /* Change the first list item text */\nElm_Object_Item *it;\nit = elm_list_first_item_get(ad-&gt;list);\nelm_object_item_text_set(it, \"Go to Second\");\n/* Add a callback */\nevas_object_smart_callback_add(ad-&gt;list, \"clicked,double\",\n                               list_item_doubleclicked_cb, ad-&gt;navi);\n        \n\n        \n      \n      \n        In the list item double-click event callback, define the content for the second view.\n\n        Create a Prev button to return to the first view, and push the button to the naviframe as a new top item. Also create the Prev button callback for popping the top item from the naviframe, and consequently displaying the first view.\n\n        Add both the new functions before the create_base_gui() function.\n\n        static void\nprev_btn_clicked_cb(void *data, Evas_Object *obj, void *event_info)\n{\n    Evas_Object *nf = data;\n    elm_naviframe_item_pop(nf);\n}\n\nstatic void\nlist_item_doubleclicked_cb(void *data, Evas_Object *obj, void *event_info)\n{\n    Evas_Object *navi_button;\n    Evas_Object *nf = data;\n    Elm_Object_Item *nf_it;\n\n    navi_button = elm_button_add(nf);\n    elm_object_text_set(navi_button, \"Prev\");\n    elm_object_style_set(navi_button, \"bottom\");\n    evas_object_smart_callback_add(navi_button, \"clicked\",\n                                   prev_btn_clicked_cb, nf);\n\n    nf_it = elm_naviframe_item_push(nf, \"Second view\", NULL,\n                                    NULL, navi_button, NULL);\n}\n        \n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n",

            "content": "Creating Your First Tizen Mobile Native Application\n\nWelcome to Tizen mobile native application development!\n\nA mobile native application is created using the C language, and can be run on Tizen mobile devices. The application uses the native API, which provides various interfaces to the device hardware allowing you to take advantage of numerous capabilities tailored to run with limited device resources.\n\nStudy the following instructions to help familiarize yourself with the Tizen native application development process as well as using the Tizen Studio and installing the created application on the emulator or target device. With the instructions, you can create and run a basic mobile native application, which displays some text on the screen with no user interaction:\n\n\n  \n    Before you get started with developing Tizen applications, download and install the Tizen Studio.\n\n    For more information on the installation process, see the installation guide.\n  \n  \n    Create a mobile native project using the Tizen Studio.\n\n    This step shows how you can use a predesigned project template that creates all the basic files and folders required for your project.\n  \n  \n    Build the application.\n\n    After you have implemented code for the features you want, this step shows how you can build the application to validate and compile the code.\n  \n  \n    Run the application.\n\n    This step shows how you can run the application on the emulator or a real target device.\n  \n  \n    Design a UI.\n\n    This step shows how you can create the application UI and make small alterations to it to improve the usability of your application.\n  \n\n\nWhen you are developing a more complex application, you can take advantage of the native tools included in the Tizen Studio to ease the tasks of creating functionality and designing the application UI.\n\n\nCreating a Project\n\nThe following example shows you how to create and configure a basic mobile native application project in the Tizen Studio. An application project contains all the files that make up an application.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the application to be created. The application screen displays the Hello Tizen text and no user interaction is provided. If you click the Back key on the device, the application moves to the background.\n\nFigure: Mobile native Basic UI application\n\n\n\nTo create the application project:\n\n\n  \n    Launch the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  \n    Make sure the Native perspective is selected in the upper-right corner of the Tizen Studio window.\n\n    \n\n    If not, select it. If the perspective is not visible, in the Tizen Studio menu, select Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other &gt; Native, and click OK.\n  \n  \n    In the Tizen Studio menu, select File &gt; New &gt; Tizen Project.\n\n    \n\n    The Project Wizard opens.\n  \n  \n    In the Project Wizard, define the project details.\n\n    The Project Wizard is used to create the basic application skeleton with the required folder structure and mandatory files. You can easily create different applications by selecting an applicable template or sample for the Project Wizard to use.\n\n    \n      \n        Select the Template project type and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the profile (Mobile) and version from a drop-down list and click Next.\n\n        The version depends on the platform version you have installed and with which you are developing the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the Native Application application type and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Select the Basic UI template and click Next.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Define the project properties and click Finish.\n\n        You can enter the project name (3-50 characters) and the unique package ID. You can also select the location and working sets by clicking More properties.\n\n        \n\n        The Project Wizard sets up the project, creates the application files using the default content from the template, and closes. For more information on the Project Wizard and the available templates, see Creating Tizen Projects with Tizen Project Wizard.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can see the created project in the Project Explorer view. The most important files and folders include:\n\n\n  \n    inc: Default folder for included source files\n  \n  \n    res: Folder for resource files used by the application only\n  \n  \n    shared: Folder for resource files to be shared with other applications\n  \n  \n    src: Folder for source code files\n  \n  \n    lib: Folder for external library files\n  \n  \n    tizen-manifest.xml: Manifest file used by the platform to install and launch the application\n  \n\n\nFigure: Application in the Project Explorer\n\n\n\n\n  Note\nYou can view and modify the application configuration in the manifest editor. In this example, no configuration changes are required.\n\n\nYour application project is now ready for further actions. Next, build the application.\n\n\nManaging the Application Configuration\n\nTo view and modify the application configuration:\n\n\n  \n    In the Project Explorer view, double-click the tizen-manifest.xml file of the application. The Tizen Studio opens the file in the manifest editor.\n  \n  \n    In the manifest editor, view and modify the configuration details using the various tabs:\n\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Overview: Define general information, such as the package, label, and icon of the application.\n      \n      \n        Features: Define required software and hardware features. This information is used for application filtering in the Tizen Store.\n      \n      \n        Privileges: Define the security-sensitive APIs or API groups accessed and used by the application.\n      \n      \n        Localization: Define localized values for the application label, description, and icon.\n      \n      \n        Advanced: Define advanced features, such as application metadata, data control for services, application control functionalities, and account details.\n      \n      \n        Source: View and edit the source code of the tizen-manifest.xml file. Changes made and saved on the other tabs are reflected in the source code and vice versa.\n\n        \n          Note\nThe tizen-manifest.xml file must conform to both the XML file format and the Tizen native application specification requirements. Editing the file in the Source tab is intended for advanced users only.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    To save any changes, in the Tizen Studio menu, select File &gt; Save All.\n  \n\n\nFor more information on configuring the application, see Setting the Application Manifest.\n\nUnderstanding the Source Code\n\nPay attention to the life-cycle callbacks in the application source code, to understand how the application works. For source code details related to the UI, see Designing a Simple UI.\n\nThe main() function in the src/basicui.c file is used to register callbacks that manage specific parts of the application life-cycle:\n\n\n  app_create\n    \n      Called when the application process starts.\n      Used to create UI components.\n    \n  \n  app_terminate\n    \n      Called while the application process is terminating.\n      Called after the main loop quits.\n    \n  \n  app_resume (UI applications only)\n    \n      Called when the application window is shown.\n    \n  \n  app_pause (UI applications only)\n    \n      Called when the application window is totally hidden.\n    \n  \n  app_control\n    \n      Called after the app_create callback when the process starts.\n      Called when a launch request is received while the process is running.\n      Can receive app_control data (parameters for launching the application).\n      Used to implement parameter-specific actions of the application.\n    \n  \n\n\nint\nmain(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    appdata_s ad = {0,};\n    int ret = 0;\n\n    ui_app_lifecycle_callback_s event_callback = {0,};\n    app_event_handler_h handlers[5] = {NULL,};\n\n    event_callback.create = app_create;\n    event_callback.terminate = app_terminate;\n    event_callback.pause = app_pause;\n    event_callback.resume = app_resume;\n    event_callback.app_control = app_control;\n\n    ret = ui_app_main(argc, argv, &amp;event_callback, &amp;ad);\n    if (ret != APP_ERROR_NONE)\n        dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, \"app_main() failed. Err = %d\", ret);\n\n    return ret;\n}\n\n\n\nBuilding Your Application\n\nAfter you have created the application project, you can implement the required features. In this example, only the default features from the project template are used, and no code changes are required.\n\nWhen your application code is ready, you must build the application. The building process performs a validation check and compiles your files.\n\nYou can build the application in the following ways:\n\n\n  \n    Automatically\n\n    The automatic build means that the Tizen Studio automatically rebuilds the application whenever you change a source or resource file and save the application project.\n\n    To use the automatic build:\n\n    \n      Select the project in the Project Explorer view.\n      \n        In the Tizen Studio menu, select Project &gt; Build Automatically.\n\n        \n\n        A check mark appears next to the menu option.\n      \n    \n\n    You can toggle the automatic build on and off by reselecting Project &gt; Build Automatically.\n  \n  \n    Manually\n\n    The manual build means that you determine yourself when the application is built.\n\n    To manually build the application, right-click the project in the Project Explorer view and select Build Project.\n\n    Figure: Manually building the application\n\n    \n\n    Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n    \n      In the Tizen Studio menu, select Project &gt; Build Project.\n      Press the F10 key.\n    \n  \n\n\nYou can have more than one build configuration. To see the current active configuration or change it, right-click the project in the Project Explorer view and select Build Configurations &gt; Set Active. The default configuration is Debug. For more information, see Building Applications.\n\nAfter you have built the application, run it.\n\n\nRunning Your Application\n\nYou can run the application on the emulator or a real target device.\n\n\nRunning on the Emulator\n\nTo run the application on the emulator:\n\n\n  Launch an emulator instance in the Emulator Manager:\n    \n      \n        In the Tizen Studio menu, select Tools &gt; Emulator Manager.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        In the Emulator Manager, select a mobile emulator from the list and click Launch.\n\n        If no applicable emulator instance exists, create a new one.\n\n        \n\n        The emulator is launched in its own window. You can also see the new emulator instance and its folder structure in the Device Manager.\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Generate a security profile.\n\n    Before you run the application, you must sign your application package with a certificate profile in the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  Run the application:\n    \n      \n        In the Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Tizen Native Application.\n\n        \n\n        Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n        \n          Press the Ctrl + F11 key.\n          Click the run icon in the toolbar.\n        \n\n        If you have created multiple emulator instances, select the instance you want from the combo box in the toolbar before selecting to run the application. If you select an offline emulator, it is automatically launched when you select to run the application.\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Confirm that the application launches on the emulator.\n\n        \n\n        \n          Note\nIf the emulator display has switched off, you cannot see the application launch. To see the application on the emulator screen:\n          \n            To switch the display on, in the key window next to the emulator screen, click Power.\n            On the home screen, swipe left.\n          \n        \n\n        While the application is running, the Log view in the Tizen Studio shows the log, debug, and exception messages from the methods defined in the log macros. To see the view, in the Tizen Studio menu, go to Window &gt; Show View &gt; Log.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nFor more information on using the emulator features, see Using Emulator Control Keys, Menu, and Panel and Using Extended Emulator Features.\n\n\nRunning on a Target Device\n\nTo run the application on a target device:\n\n\n  Connect the mobile target device to your computer using a USB cable.\n  \n    Generate an author certificate.\n\n    Before you run the application, you must sign your application package with a certificate profile in the Tizen Studio.\n  \n  Run the application:\n    \n      In the Device Manager, select the device.\n      \n        In Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Tizen Native Application.\n\n        \n\n        Alternatively, you can also select the project in the Project Explorer view and do one of the following:\n\n        \n          Press the Ctrl + F11 key.\n          Click the run icon in the toolbar.\n        \n\n        If you have both a connected device and existing emulator instances, select the device from the combo box in the toolbar before selecting to run the application.\n\n        \n      \n      Confirm that the application launches on the target device.\n    \n\n    \n      Note\nThe application is launched using the default debug run configuration. To create and use another configuration:\n      \n        In the Project Explorer view, right-click the project and select Run As &gt; Run Configurations.\n        In the Run Configurations window, click the New Launch Configuration icon (), define the configuration details, and launch the application by clicking Run.\n   \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nDesigning a Simple UI\n\nThe mobile application created with the Basic UI template has a simple user interface with a label component showing the Hello Tizen text at the top of the screen. The UI is created using EFL.\n\nFigure: User interface in the Basic UI template\n\n\n\nCreating the Basic UI\n\nThe UI in the Basic UI template contains the following components:\n\n\n  The EFL UI always contains a window component, which is the root component of the entire UI.\n  Since the application has the indicator bar at the top of the screen, it requires the conformant component.\n  The text label is implemented with a label component.\n\n\nThe UI is created in the basicui.c file:\n\n\n  \n    Data structure\n\n    A pointer to the UI components is stored in the appdata_s data structure:\n\n    struct appdata {\n    /* Window */\n    Evas_Object *win;\n    /* Conformant */\n    Evas_Object *conform;\n    /* Label */\n    Evas_Object *label;\n};\ntypedef struct appdata appdata_s;\n    \n  \n  \n    UI creation\n\n    The app_create() life-cycle callback is called when the application main loop starts, and it calls the create_base_gui() function to create the UI:\n\n     static bool\n app_create(void *data)\n {\n     /*\n        Hook to take necessary actions before the main event loop starts\n        Initialize UI resources and application data\n        If this function returns true, the application main loop starts\n        If this function returns false, the application is terminated\n     */\n     appdata_s *ad = data;\n\n     create_base_gui(ad);\n\n     return true;\n }\n\n  \n  \n    UI components\n    \n      \n        The create_base_gui() function creates the UI components: window, conformant, and label.\n\n        The function receives a pointer to fill in the appdata_s structure.\n\n        static void\ncreate_base_gui(appdata_s *ad)\n{\n        \n      \n      \n        The window component is created with the elm_win_util_standard_add() function.\n\n        Callbacks are also added for the window: one of the callbacks handles the delete,request event when the window is to be closed, and the other handles the EEXT_CALLBACK_BACK event when the hardware Back key is pressed.\n\n             /*\n        Window\n        Create and initialize elm_win, which is mandatory to manipulate a window\n     */\n     ad-&gt;win = elm_win_util_standard_add(PACKAGE, PACKAGE);\n     elm_win_autodel_set(ad-&gt;win, EINA_TRUE);\n\n     if (elm_win_wm_rotation_supported_get(ad-&gt;win)) {\n         int rots[4] = {0, 90, 180, 270};\n         elm_win_wm_rotation_available_rotations_set(ad-&gt;win,\n                                                     (const int *)(&amp;rots), 4);\n     }\n     evas_object_smart_callback_add(ad-&gt;win, \"delete,request\",\n                                    win_delete_request_cb, NULL);\n     eext_object_event_callback_add(ad-&gt;win, EEXT_CALLBACK_BACK, win_back_cb, ad);\n\n      \n      \n        The conformant component is needed to show the indicator bar at the top of the screen:\n\n        \n          The component is the first object added inside the window with the elm_conformant_add() function.\n          The elm_win_indicator_mode_set() function decides whether the indicator is visible, and the elm_win_indicator_opacity_set() function sets the indicator opacity mode.\n          The conformant component is set as a resize object of the window by using the elm_win_resize_object_add() function. It means that the conformant size and position are controlled by the window component directly.\n          The evas_object_show() function makes the conformant component visible.\n        \n\n             /*\n        Conformant\n        Create and initialize elm_conformant, which is mandatory for the base GUI\n        to have a proper size when an indicator or virtual keypad is visible\n     */\n     ad-&gt;conform = elm_conformant_add(ad-&gt;win);\n     elm_win_indicator_mode_set(ad-&gt;win, ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_SHOW);\n     elm_win_indicator_opacity_set(ad-&gt;win, ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_OPAQUE);\n     evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;conform, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND,\n                                      EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n     elm_win_resize_object_add(ad-&gt;win, ad-&gt;conform);\n     evas_object_show(ad-&gt;conform);\n        \n      \n      \n        The label component for the text is added with the elm_label_add() function. The label is added inside the conformant component, which is the label’s parent.\n\n        The label text is set with the elm_object_text_set() function.\n\n             /*\n        Label\n        Create an actual view of the base GUI\n        Modify this part to change the view\n     */\n     ad-&gt;label = elm_label_add(ad-&gt;conform);\n     elm_object_text_set(ad-&gt;label, \"&lt;align=center&gt;Hello Tizen&lt;/align&gt;\");\n     evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;label, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND,\n                                      EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n     elm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;label);\n        \n      \n      \n        When all the UI components are ready, the evas_object_show() function makes the window component visible. This means that the window displays everything on the screen at once.\n\n             /* Show the window after the base GUI is set up */\n     evas_object_show(ad-&gt;win);\n }\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nModifying Existing Components\n\nWhen the basic UI exists, you can easily modify the components in the UI by using the component-specific functions, or more general Evas object functions.\n\nFor example, the following modifications to the label component change the label style to a marker (making the text bold) and increase the font size to 50:\n\n/* Label */\nad-&gt;label = elm_label_add(ad-&gt;conform);\nelm_object_text_set(ad-&gt;label, \"&lt;align=center&gt;&lt;font_size=50&gt;Hello Tizen&lt;/font/&gt;&lt;/align&gt;\");\nelm_object_style_set(ad-&gt;label, \"marker\");\nevas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;label, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\nelm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;label);\n\n\nFigure: Modified label component\n\n\n\nAdding More Components and Functionality\n\nThe basic UI only contains one visible label component. You can use it as a basis to design a more elaborate UI with more components, screens, and functionality. The following example shows how to add a list and button to the existing view (screen), and how to create a second view and move between the 2 views.\n\nAll the code changes in this section are made within the create_base_gui() function, unless stated otherwise.\n\nTo add more content to the UI:\n\n\n  \n    Modify the existing label view to contain a list and button too.\n\n    To add more components, first create a container that can hold all the various components in one view.\n\n    In this example, the box container is used. It is created and added to the conformant. The new list and button are created, and then the new components, and the existing label component, are all added to the box.\n\n    \n      \n        Add the box, list, and button objects to the appdata_s data structure:\n\n        struct appdata {\n    Evas_Object *win;\n    Evas_Object *conform;\n    Evas_Object *label;\n    /* Box */\n    Evas_Object *box;\n    /* List */\n    Evas_Object *list;\n    /* Button */\n    Evas_Object *button;\n};\ntypedef struct appdata appdata_s;\n        \n      \n      \n        Create the box component using the conformant as the parent, and set the box as the conformant content:\n\n         ad-&gt;box = elm_box_add(ad-&gt;conform);\n evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;box, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n evas_object_show(ad-&gt;box);\n elm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;box);\n        \n      \n      \n        Modify the existing label component to use box as a parent, and add it to the box:\n\n         /* Modify the label code */\n ad-&gt;label = elm_label_add(ad-&gt;box);\n elm_object_text_set(ad-&gt;label, \"&lt;align=center&gt;Hello Tizen&lt;/align&gt;\");\n evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;label, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n /* Comment out the elm_object_content_set() function */\n /* elm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;label); */\n evas_object_size_hint_align_set(ad-&gt;label, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);\n evas_object_size_hint_min_set(ad-&gt;label, 100, 100);\n /* Show and add to box */\n evas_object_show(ad-&gt;label);\n elm_box_pack_end(ad-&gt;box, ad-&gt;label);\n        \n      \n      \n        Create the list and add it to the box:\n\n        \n          \n            Create a list component with the elm_list_add() function.\n\n            The box component is the parent of the new list component.\n          \n          \n            Add items to the list with the elm_list_item_append() function.\n          \n        \n\n         int i;\n /* Create the list */\n ad-&gt;list = elm_list_add(ad-&gt;box);\n /* Set the list size */\n evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;list, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n evas_object_size_hint_align_set(ad-&gt;list, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);\n\n for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {\n     char tmp[8];\n     snprintf(tmp, sizeof(tmp), \"Item %d\", i + 1);\n     /* Add an item to the list */\n     elm_list_item_append(ad-&gt;list, tmp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);\n }\n /* Show and add to box */\n evas_object_show(ad-&gt;list);\n elm_box_pack_end(ad-&gt;box, ad-&gt;list);\n        \n      \n      \n        Create the button using the box as the parent, and add the button to the box:\n\n         /* Create the button */\n ad-&gt;button = elm_button_add(ad-&gt;box);\n evas_object_size_hint_align_set(ad-&gt;button, EVAS_HINT_FILL, EVAS_HINT_FILL);\n /* Set the button text */\n elm_object_text_set(ad-&gt;button, \"Next\");\n /* Show and add to box */\n evas_object_show(ad-&gt;button);\n elm_box_pack_end(ad-&gt;box, ad-&gt;button);\n        \n      \n    \n\n    When you run the application, the screen now shows the label at the top, the list in the middle, and the button at the bottom.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Create another view and navigate between the views.\n\n    The previous step created a view that contained a box component with various other components in the box. To create an application with multiple views, you need to add a naviframe component to the application.\n\n    \n      \n        Add the naviframe and naviframe item objects to the appdata_s data structure:\n\n        struct appdata {\n    Evas_Object *win;\n    Evas_Object *conform;\n    Evas_Object *label;\n    Evas_Object *box;\n    Evas_Object *list;\n    Evas_Object *button;\n    /* Naviframe */\n    Evas_Object *navi;\n    /* Item */\n    Elm_Object_Item *navi_item;\n};\ntypedef struct appdata appdata_s;\n        \n      \n      \n        Create the naviframe using the conformant as the parent:\n\n         ad-&gt;navi = elm_naviframe_add(ad-&gt;conform);\n evas_object_show(ad-&gt;navi);\n elm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;navi);\n        \n      \n      \n        Modify the box component to have the naviframe as a parent:\n\n         ad-&gt;box = elm_box_add(ad-&gt;navi);\n evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;box, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n evas_object_show(ad-&gt;box);\n elm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;navi, ad-&gt;box);\n        \n      \n      \n        Push the box to the naviframe as a top item to create the first view. The second parameter defines a title text for the view.\n\n        Each application view is a separate item in the naviframe, and the top item is always displayed.\n\n         ad-&gt;navi_item = elm_naviframe_item_push(ad-&gt;navi, \"View with list\",\n                                         NULL, NULL, ad-&gt;box, NULL);\n        \n      \n      \n        Create the navigation between the views by adding a click event callback for the Next button. When the user clicks the button, the second view opens.\n\n         /* Create the button */\n\n evas_object_show(ad-&gt;button);\n evas_object_smart_callback_add(ad-&gt;button, \"clicked\",\n                                next_btn_clicked_cb, ad-&gt;navi);\n elm_box_pack_end(ad-&gt;box, ad-&gt;button);\n        \n\n        \n      \n      \n        In the Next button click event callback, define the content for the second view.\n\n        Create a Prev button to return to the first view, and push the button to the naviframe as a new top item. Also create the Prev button callback for popping the top item from the naviframe, and consequently displaying the first view.\n\n        Add both the new functions before the create_base_gui() function.\n\n         static void\n prev_btn_clicked_cb(void *data, Evas_Object *obj, void *event_info)\n {\n     Evas_Object *nf = data;\n     elm_naviframe_item_pop(nf);\n }\n\n static void\n next_btn_clicked_cb(void *data, Evas_Object *obj, void *event_info)\n {\n     Evas_Object *navi_button2;\n     Evas_Object *nf = data;\n     Elm_Object_Item *nf_it;\n\n     navi_button2 = elm_button_add(nf);\n     elm_object_text_set(navi_button2, \"Prev\");\n     evas_object_smart_callback_add(navi_button2, \"clicked\",\n                                    prev_btn_clicked_cb, nf);\n\n     nf_it = elm_naviframe_item_push(nf, \"View with button\", NULL,\n                                     NULL, navi_button2, NULL);\n }\n        \n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n",

GBS finds all RPM packages within the directory.\n    \n\n    To configure a repository, see GBS Configuration.\n  \n  Project build configurations (such as macros and flags)\n\n\nThe following figure shows the basic GBS build workflow. The figure illustrates that input and output are both repositories, and the output repository is located at ~/GBS-ROOT/locals/repos/ by default. You can change the repository path by using the --buildroot option.\n\nFigure: GBS build workflow\n\n ____________________\n|                    |      ___________\n| Source Code (GIT)  |----&gt;|           |      _________________________\n|____________________|     |           |     |                         |\n ____________________      |           |     |  Local repository of    |\n|                    |     |           |     |                         |\n|    Build config    |----&gt;| GBS build |----&gt;|                         |\n|____________________|     |           |     |                         |\n ____________________      |           |     |  build RPM packages     |\n|                    |     |           |     |(~/GBS-ROOT/local/repos/)|\n|Binary repositories |     |           |     |_________________________|\n|in GBS conf         |----&gt;|___________|                  |\n|(Remote or Local)   |           ^                        |\n|____________________|           |________________________|\n\n\nLocal repos in the GBS build root (~/GBS-ROOT by default) affect build results, so make sure that repositories do not contain old or unnecessary RPM packages. While running the gbs build command, you can specify the --clean-repos option to clean up local GBS-created repositories before building. To avoid problems, also set a different GBS build root directory for each profile. The GBS build directory can be defined in many ways:\n\n\n  By default, the GBS build puts all output files under ~/GBS-ROOT/.\n  If the TIZEN_BUILD_ROOT environment variable exists, ${TIZEN_BUILD_ROOT} is used as the output top directory.\n  If the -B option is specified, the specified directory is used, even if ${TIZEN_BUILD_ROOT} exists.\n\n\n\n  Note\n\n  All RPM packages under the output repository (by default, ~/GBS-ROOT/local/repos/&lt;VERSION&gt;/) are used when building packages. Since all the packages under the output repository are applied to the build environment, avoid unexpected results by making sure that the output repository is clean.\n\n\nThe following example shows the structure of the GBS build root directory in the workflow output:\n\n``\ngbs output top dir\n|– local\n| |– cache # repodata and RPMs from remote repositories\n| |– repos # generated local repo top directory\n| | |– tizen # distro one: tizen\n| | | |– armv7l # store armv7l RPM packages\n| | | |– i586 # store x86 RPM packages\n| | -- tizen2.0 # build for distro two: tizen2.0\n| | – i586 # the same as above\n| |– scratch.armv7l.0 # first build root for arm build\n| |– scratch.i586.0 # second build root for x86 build\n| |– scratch.i586.1 # third build root for x86 build\n| |– scratch.i586.2 # fourth build root for x86 build\n| |– scratch.i586.3 # fifth build root for x86 build\n| | # The above build root dir can be used by gbs chroot \n| `-- sources # sources generated for build, including tarball, spec, patches, etc.\n| |-- tizen\n| `-- tizen2.0\n`-- meta # meta data used by gbs\n\n## Examples\n\nTo perform a basic build:\n\n- Build a single package:\n\n$ cd package1$ gbs build -A i586\n\n- Build a package for different architectures:\n   &gt; **Note**\n   &gt;\n   &gt; Supported architectures include x86_64, i586, armv6l, armv7hl, armv7l, aarch64, mips, and mipsel.\n\n  ```bash\n  $ gbs build -A armv7l #build package for armv7l\n  $ gbs build -A i586 #build package for i586\n\n\n\n  \n    Make a clean build by deleting the old build root.\nThe --clean option must be specified if the repository has been changed, for example, to another release.\n\n    $ gbs build -A armv7l --clean\n    \n  \n  Build the package with a specific commit:\n    $ gbs build -A armv7l --commit=&lt;COMMIT_ID&gt;\n    \n  \n  Use the --overwrite option to trigger a rebuild.\nIf you have already built before, and want to rebuild, specify the --overwrite option or the packages are skipped.\n    $ gbs build -A i586 --overwrite\n    \n\n    If you change the commit or specify the --include-all option, it always rebuilds. In these cases, the --overwrite option is not needed.\n  \n  Output the debug info:\n    $ gbs build -A i586 --debug\n    \n  \n  Build against a local repository.\nYou can configure the local repo in the .gbs.conf file or through the command line.\n    $ gbs build -R /path/to/repo/dir/ -A i586\n    \n  \n  \n    Use the --noinit option to build a package in offline mode.\nThis option can only be used if the build root is ready. When it is used, GBS does not connect the remote repository, and skips parsing and checking the repository and initializing the build environment. The package is built directly.\n\n    $ gbs build -A i586 # build first and create build environment\n$ gbs build -A i586 --noinit # use --noinit to start building directly\n    \n  \n  Build with all uncommitted changes using the --include-all option.\nIn the following examples, the Git tree contains 1 modified file and 2 extra files:\n    $ git status -s\nM ail.pc.in\n?? base.repo\n?? main.repo\n    \n    \n      \n        Build without the --include-all option\n\n        Only committed files are built. None of the modified files, which are neither committed nor added, are built:\n\n        $ gbs build -A i586\nwarning: the following untracked files would NOT be included: base.repo main.repo\nwarning: the following uncommitted changes would NOT be included: ail.pc.in\nwarning: you can specify '--include-all' option to include these uncommitted and untracked files.\n....\ninfo: Binaries RPM packages can be found here:\n/home/test/GBS-ROOT/local/scratch.i586.0/home/abuild/rpmbuild/RPMS/\ninfo: Done\n        \n      \n      \n        Build with the --include-all option\n\n        All the files are built:\n        $ gbs build -A i586\nwarning: the following untracked files would NOT be included: base.repo main.repo\nwarning: the following uncommitted changes would NOT be included: ail.pc.in\nwarning: you can specify '--include-all' option to include these uncommitted and untracked files.\n....\ninfo: Binaries RPM packages can be found here:\n/home/test/GBS-ROOT/local/scratch.i586.0/home/abuild/rpmbuild/RPMS/\ninfo: Done\n        \n      \n      \n        Use .gitignore to ignore specific files when using the --include-all option.\n\n        If you want to ignore some file types, update your .gitignore:\n\n        $ cat .gitignore\n.*\n*/.*\n*.pyc\n*.patch*\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIncremental Build\n\nStarting from GBS 0.10, the gbs build subcommand supports the --incremental option, which allows you to build incrementally.\n\nThe incremental mode is designed for development and verification of single packages. It is not intended to replace the standard mode. Only 1 package can be built at a time using the incremental mode.\n\nThe incremental mode sets up the build environment in multiple steps, finishing by mounting the local Git tree of a package in the chroot build environment.\n\n\n  Note\n\n  Because GBS mounts your Git tree to the build root, be very careful when you remove your build root. You need to make sure you have already unmounted the source tree manually before you remove it.\n\n\nThe incremental mode has the following benefits:\n\n\n  The build environment uses the latest source code and changes to source do not trigger a new build environment (in the chroot).\n  The Git source tree becomes the source of the builds. Any change made in the Git repository followed by invocation of the build script builds the changed sources.\n  If the build fails for some reason, the build script continues from the spot where it has failed, once the code has been changed to fix the problem causing the failure.\n\n\nIncremental building is, in many ways, similar to traditional code development, where changes are made to sources, followed by running make to test and compile the changes. However, it enables development using the build environment of the target, instead of the host OS.\n\nThe incremental mode has some limitations, mostly related to packaging and how the sources are maintained. Among others, it depends on how the RPM spec file is composed:\n\n\n  \n    The incremental mode does not support patches in the spec file. All source has to be maintained as part of the Git tree.\n  \n  \n    The incremental mode requires a clean packaging workflow. Exotic workflows in the spec files do not always work well, because the incremental mode expects the following model:\n\n    \n      Code preparation (%prep)\n      Code building (%build)\n      Code installation (%install)\n    \n  \n  \n    The %prep section can only contain the %setup macro to unpack the tarball, and must not contain other source code-related operations, such as unpacking another source or applying patches.\n  \n  \n    Because the %build section is run every time, if the %build script has configuration scripts (auto-tools), binaries can be regenerated, causing a complete build every time. To avoid this, use the following macros, which can be overridden using the --no-configure option:\n\n    \n      %configure: runs the configure script with pre-defined paths and options.\n      %reconfigure: regenerates the scripts and runs %configure.\n      %autogen: runs the autogen script.\n    \n  \n  \n    You can build only a single package. You cannot build multiple packages in parallel.\n  \n  \n    The tarball’s name in the spec file must be %{name}-%{version}.{tar.gz|tar.bz2|zip|...}. Otherwise, GBS cannot mount the source code to build the root correctly.\n  \n\n\nThe following example uses the dlog source code. First, it builds with the --incremental option, then modifies 1 source file and triggers the incremental build again. You can see that only modified source code gets compiled during the incremental build.\n\n$ cd dlog\n# first build:\n$ gbs build -A i586 --incremental\n$ vim log.c # change code\n# second build:\n$ gbs build -A i586 --incremental\ninfo: generate repositories ...\ninfo: build conf has been downloaded at:\n/var/tmp/test-gbs/tizen.conf\ninfo: Start building packages from: /home/test/packages/dlog (git)\ninfo: Prepare sources...\ninfo: Retrieving repo metadata...\ninfo: Parsing package data...\ninfo: *** overwriting dlog-0.4.1-5.1 i586 ***\ninfo: Next pass:\ndlog\ninfo: *** building dlog-0.4.1-5.1 i586 tizen (worker: 0) ***\ninfo: Doing incremental build\n[ 0s] Memory limit set to 10854336KB\n[ 0s] Using BUILD_ROOT=/home/test/GBS-ROOT/local/scratch.i586.0\n[ 0s] Using BUILD_ARCH=i686:i586:i486:i386:noarch\n[ 0s] test-desktop started \"build dlog.spec\" at Thu Sep 13 07:36:14 UTC 2012.\n[ 0s] -----------------------------------------------------------------\n[ 0s] ----- building dlog.spec (user abuild)\n[ 0s] -----------------------------------------------------------------\n[ 0s] -----------------------------------------------------------------\n[ 0s] + rpmbuild --short-circuit -bc /home/abuild/rpmbuild/SOURCES/dlog.spec\n[ 0s] Executing(%build): /bin/sh -e /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.XLz8je\n[ 0s] + umask 022\n[ 0s] + export LD_AS_NEEDED\n[ 4s] + make -j4\n[ 4s] make all-am\n[ 4s] make[1]: Entering directory /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/dlog-0.4.1\n[ 4s] /bin/sh ./libtool --tag=CC --mode=compile gcc -c -o log.lo log.c\n[ 4s] mv -f .deps/log.Tpo .deps/log.Plo\n[ 4s] /bin/sh ./libtool --tag=CC --mode=link gcc -o libdlog.la /usr/lib log.lo\n[ 4s] libtool: link: gcc -shared .libs/log.o -o .libs/libdlog.so.0.0.0\n[ 4s] libtool: link: ar cru .libs/libdlog.a log.o\n[ 4s] libtool: link: ranlib .libs/libdlog.a\n[ 4s] make[1]: Leaving directory /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/dlog-0.4.1\n[ 4s] + exit 0\n[ 4s] finished \"build dlog.spec\" at Thu Sep 13 07:36:18 UTC 2012.\n[ 4s]\ninfo: finished incremental building dlog\ninfo: Local repo can be found here:\n/home/test/GBS-ROOT/local/repos/tizen/\ninfo: Done\n\n\nFrom the build log, you can see that only log.c has been re-compiled. That is the point of the incremental build behavior.\n\nThe --noinit option can be used together with --incremental to make a build more quickly:\n\n$ gbs build --incremental --noinit\n\n\nMultiple Package Build (Dependency Build)\n\nMultiple package build has been supported since GBS 0.10. If packages have dependencies on each other, GBS builds them in the correct order calculated by the dependency relationships. Previously built RPMs are used to build the packages that depend on them. This process is called a dependency build.\n\nTo perform a multiple package build:\n\n\n  \n    Build all packages under a specific package directory:\n\n    $ mkdir tizen-packages\n$ cp package1 package2 package3 ... tizen-packages/\n$ gbs build -A i586 tizen-packages # build all packages under tizen-packages\n    \n  \n  \n    Build multiple packages in parallel with the --threads option:\n\n    # current directory have multiple packages, --threads can be used to set the max build worker at the same time\n$ gbs build -A armv7l --threads=4\n    \n  \n  \n    Select a group of packages to be built:\n\n    \n      The --binary-from-file option specifies a text file that contains a name list of RPM packages to be built. The format in the text file is 1 package per line.\n      The --binary-list option specifies a list in which the package names are separated by commas.\n    \n\n    When the number of packages is small and the packages can be clearly listed in the command line, use the --binary-list option for simplicity.\n\n    $ gbs build -A i586 --binary-from-file=/path/to/packages.list\n$ gbs build -A i586 --binary-list=&lt;pkg1&gt;,&lt;pkg2&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    Exclude certain packages:\n\n    \n      The --exclude option specifies a list in which the names of packages to be ignored are separated by commas.\n      The --exclude-from-file option specifies a text file that contains a name list of packages to be ignored.\n    \n\n    $ gbs build -A i586 tizen-packages --exclude=&lt;pkg1&gt;\n$ gbs build -A i586 tizen-packages --exclude=&lt;pkg1&gt;,&lt;pkg2&gt;\n$ gbs build -A i586 tizen-packages --exclude-from-file=/path/to/packages.list\n    \n  \n  \n    Build packages based on dependencies:\n\n    \n      The --deps option enables GBS to build specific packages, together with all related packages on which they depend.\n      The --rdep option enables GBS to build specific packages, together with all related packages that depend on them.\n    \n\n    The specific packages can be included by the --binary-from-file or --binary-list option, and excluded by the --exclude or --exclude-from-file option.\n\n    The --deps and --rdep options are compatible. When added at the same time, besides the specific packages, GBS builds not only the related packages on which they depend, but also all the related packages that depend on them.\n\n    $ gbs build -A i586 --binary-list=&lt;pkg1&gt;,&lt;pkg2&gt; --deps\n$ gbs build -A i586 --binary-list=&lt;pkg1&gt;,&lt;pkg2&gt; --rdeps\n$ gbs build -A i586 --binary-list=&lt;pkg1&gt;,&lt;pkg2&gt; --deps --rdeps\n    \n  \n\n\nUseful Building Options\n\nThe gbs build command offers some useful options:\n\n\n  \n    Install extra packages to build a root\n\n    The --extra-packs=&lt;packages separated by commas&gt; option can be used to install extra packages:\n\n    $ gbs build -A i586 --extra-packs=&lt;pkg1&gt;,&lt;pkg2&gt; --deps\n$ gbs build -A i586 --extra-packs=&lt;pkg1&gt;,&lt;pkg2&gt; --rdeps\n$ gbs build -A i586 --extra-packs=&lt;pkg1&gt;,&lt;pkg2&gt; --deps --rdeps\n    \n  \n  \n    Keep all packages in the build root\n\n    Generally, the GBS build removes unnecessary packages in the build root. While transferring to build another package, you can use the --keep-packs option to keep all unnecessary packages, and just install missing required build packages. This option can be used to speed up building multiple packages.\n\n    $ gbs build --keep-packs\n    \n\n    The --keep-packs option can be used to create 1 build root for building multiple packages. Once the build root is ready, you can use the --noinit option to build these packages quickly.\n\n    $ gbs build pkg1/ --keep-packs -A i586\n$ gbs build pkg2/ --keep-packs -A i586\n$ gbs build pkg3/ --keep-packs -A i586\n    \n\n    Now, the build root (~/GBS-ROOT/local/scratch.i586.0) is ready for building pkg1, pkg2, and pkg3. You can use the --noinit option to build them offline, and need waste no time to check for repository updates and build root.\n\n    $ gbs build pkg1 --noinit\n$ gbs build pkg2 --noinit\n$ gbs build pkg3 --noinit\n    \n  \n\n\nForcing GBS to Work in the Native Mode\n\nUse the --fallback-to-native option to force GBS to perform packaging for non-native packages in the native packaging mode in the packaging phase of the building process, that is, ignore the upstream branch and create a tarball from HEAD (by default) or specified commit without generating any patch. Adding the --fallback-to-native option when issuing the gbs build or gbs export command is equivalent to adding the fallback_to_native = true property into the [general] section of the GBS configuration file.\n\n\n  Note\n\n  This option serves as a work-around solution for solving export failures of some non-native packages caused by a tricky engineering problem. For Tizen native packages, GBS always performs packaging in the native packaging mode.\n\n\n$ gbs build -A i586 --fallback-to-native\n\n\nSkipping the Building of the src.rpm File\n\nNormally, 2 types of package files are created during the package building process:\n\n\n  Binary, or executable, package file\n  Source package file\n\n\nThe source package file (src.rpm) contains everything needed to recreate a specific version of a package. This makes the src.rpm file a great way to distribute source code. However, it is optional when developing source code, especially when the source Git tree is huge.\n\nAdding the --skip-srcrpm option enables GBS to skip the building of the src.rpm file, speeding up the building process of huge source Git trees during development:\n\n$ cd &lt;Path_to_crosswalk&gt;\n$ gbs build -A i586 --skip-srcrpm\n\n\nUsing Distributed Compiler Networks\n\nThough GBS provides the --threads option to speed up the build process by activating multiple build workers, the efficiency of just using multiple build workers in 1 local machine is far from satisfactory, especially for a huge Git tree, such as crosswalk.\n\nTo improve the build process efficiency further, use the --icecream option, which activates distributed compiler networks. The option makes GBS use build workers on both the local machine and distributed networks.\n\n$ gbs build -A i586 --icecream=10\n\n\nFetching the Project Build Conf and Customizing the Build Root (for Advanced Users)\n\nThe project build conf describes the build configurations for the project, including all macros, packages, and flags predefined in the build environment. In Tizen releases, the build conf is released together with the released repository.\n\n\n  \n    Fetch the build conf automatically with the gbs build command\n\n    Starting from GBS 0.7.1, by default, GBS fetches the build conf from a remote repository (if you specify the remote Tizen repository) and stores it in your temporary environment:\n\n    $ gbs build -A i586\ninfo: generate repositories ...\ninfo: build conf has been downloaded at:\n/var/tmp/&lt;user&gt;-gbs/tizen2.0.conf\ninfo: generate tar ball: packaging/acpid-2.0.14.tar.bz2\n[sudo] password for &lt;user&gt;:\n    \n  \n  \n    Build the package using your own project build conf, by using the -D option\n\n    You can save and modify the build conf, and use it for your own purposes:\n\n    $ cp /var/tmp/&lt;user&gt;-gbs/tizen2.0.conf ~/tizen2.0.conf\n$ gbs build -A i586 -D ~/tizen2.0.conf\n    \n  \n\n\nTo customize the build config, see http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_prjconf.\n",

What is wrong?\nA: This can be caused by proxy settings. Double-check the proxy settings and add the -E option when running the sudo zypper refresh command. If that solves the problem, preserve the environment variables by modifying /etc/sudoers. For more information, see Setting up Development Environment.\n\nAnother possible reason is a cached version at the proxy server. Try running the following commands to clean the cache:\n# clean the cache from proxy server or remote http server\n$ wget --no-cache http://download.tizen.org/tools/latest-release/openSUSE_13.2/repodata/repomd.xml\n$ zypper refresh\n$ zypper install gbs\n\n\nQ: I installed GBS from the official repository, so why is it trying to use source code from /usr/local/lib/python*?\nA: This can be because you have installed GBS from source code before. Remove it and re-install.\n\nQ: How do I update GBS and its dependencies?\nA: GBS is open source software. For more information, see Installing Development Tools.\n\nGBS Build Issues\n\nQ: How can I make my local repository have a higher priority than the remote repository?\nA: The priority depends on the order of repositories; the first repository has the highest priority. In v0.10 and higher, GBS automatically puts local repositories before remote repositories.\n\nQ: The gbs build command reports a build expansion error: “nothing provides X needed by Y”. What is wrong?\nA: The package you are trying to build is missing a dependency in the repository you specified. You need to configure or add an additional repository. Try using the release repository, instead of the snapshot repository.\n\nQ: The gbs build command exits unexpectedly when installing packages to create a build root.\nA: This can be caused by a remote repository having been changed. Specify --clean while running the GBS build:\n\n$ gbs build -A &lt;arch&gt; --clean ...\n\n\nQ: The gbs build command exits unexpectedly with errors: “file XXXX from install of YYYYY conflicts with file from package ZZZZZ”. What is wrong?\nA: This can be caused by a remote repository having been changed. Specify --clean while running the GBS build:\n\n$ gbs build -A &lt;arch&gt; --clean ...\n\n\nQ: The gbs build command exits with errors: “have choice for XXXX needed by packagename: package1 package2”. What is wrong?\nA: This can be caused by a remote repository having 2 packages providing XXXX, and GBS not knowing which one to use. In this case, download the build config and add the following line:\n\nPrefer: package1\n\n\nor\n\nPrefer: package2\n\n\nFor more information on downloading and customizing the build config, see gbs build.\n\nQ: The gbs build command fails to create an arm build environment on Ubuntu 11.10. What is wrong?\nA: This can be caused by qemu. The qemu-user-static option has some issues with the Ubuntu official repository. Remove qemu-user-static and install qemu-arm-static from the Tizen tools repository with the following commands:\n\n$ dpkg -r --force-depends qemu-user-static\n$ apt-get update\n$ apt-get install qemu-arm-static\n\n\nGBS Remote Build Issues\n\nQ: Why cannot I access the remote build server (OBS) during a remote build?\nA: The access requires that you have a username and password and that you set them correctly in the configuration file. Also, make sure the build server API and proxy settings are correct for your environment.\n\nProxy Issues\n\nQ: The export no_proxy=\"localhost; 127.0.0.1; .company.com command does not work on Ubuntu. Why?\nA: Set no_proxy as .company.com directly, and try again.\n\nQ: The gbs build command returns “500 Can’t connect to xxx”. What is wrong?\nA: Check whether the proxy environment variable has a trailing ‘/’, and remove it from whatever is setting your environment variables. This is a known bug in the perl library, and it is fixed in GBS 0.11.\n\nQ: The gbs build command returns “500 SSL negotiation failed error”. What is wrong?\nA: This is caused by the proxy server setting. The proxy you specified cannot forward SSL correctly. Try using another proxy.\n\nGBS chroot Issues\n\nQ: The gbs chroot -r &lt;build_root&gt; command reports an error: “su: user root does not exist”. What is wrong?\nA: This is caused by missing a login package while creating a build root. You can fix by updating /etc/passwd and /etc/group to add a root user:\n\n$ echo \"root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\" &gt;&gt;path/to/buildroot/etc/passwd$ echo \"root:x:0:\" &gt;&gt;path/to/buildroot/etc/group\n\n\nMiscellaneous Issues\n\nQ: Fedora GBS shows an error: “&lt;user&gt; is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported”. What is wrong?\nA: Update /etc/sudoers to give &lt;user&gt; sudo permission.\n",

            "title": "Maintenance Models Supported by GBS",
            "content": "Maintenance Models Supported by GBS\n\nFrom a package maintenance point of view, packages can be divided into 2 categories:\n\n\n  Native packages, where you (Tizen) are the upstream and control the source code repository. An example in the context of Tizen could be power-manager. For native packages, you control the versioning and releasing, so package maintenance is simpler. You can release a new version basically whenever you want.\n  Non-native (or upstream) packages, for which you (Tizen) are not the upstream. For example, the Linux kernel or zlib. For these packages, you need to follow the releasing process and schedule of the upstream project. For example, from a developer and legal point of view, it is very beneficial to clearly track the local modifications (that is, separate upstream and local changes) both in the source code repository and on the packaging level.\n\n\nGBS divides packages into these 2 categories. GBS determines a package as non-native, if the Git repository has an upstream branch. The actual name of the upstream branch can be configured using the upstream_branch  option in the .gbs.conf file or with the --upstream-branch command line option.\n\nGBS build, remotebuild, and export commands behave differently for native and non-native packages. Namely, the preparation of the packaging files for building differs.\n\nGBS currently supports 2 different maintenance models for non-native packages: one with packaging and source code in the same branch and one with separate packaging and development branches.\n\nGBS and Native Packages\n\nGBS simply creates a monolithic source tarball from the HEAD of the current branch. Packaging files, from the packaging directory, are copied as is. No patch generation is done.\n\nThe Git repository layout looks like this:\n\n         v1.0    v2.0\n            |       |\no---A---B---C---D---E   master\n\n\nGBS and Non-native Packages with Joint-packaging\n\nIn the joint-packaging model (where packaging and development are in the same branch), packaging data (spec file etc) is kept in the same branch with the source code:\n\n              F---G---H   master (packaging + code changes)\n             /\no---A---B---C---D---E     upstream\n            |       |\n          v1.0    v2.0\n\n\nGBS tries to create a (real) upstream source tarball, auto-generate patches from the local changes, and auto-update the spec file accordingly. The logic is the following:\n\n\n  Generate patches\n    \n      Create patches between upstream-tag…HEAD, and remove possible old patches\n      Update the spec file: remove old Patch: tags and %patch macros and replace them with ones that correspond with the newly generated patches.\n    \n  \n  Create an upstream tarball if patch-generation was successful\n    \n      If the Git repository has a pristine-tar branch (and you have the pristine-tar tool installed), GBS tries to checkout the source tarball with pristine-tar.\n      If the previous step fails, GBS tries to create a source tarball from the correct upstream tag, matching the version taken from the .spec file.\n    \n  \n  If the source tarball or patch generation fails, GBS reverts back to the old method (that is, treats the package as native), creating just 1 monolithic tarball without patch generation.\n\n\nYou cannot have any pre-existing patches in the packaging directory or spec file. Otherwise, GBS refuses to create patches. For information on manually maintained patches, see Manually Maintained Patches.\n\nGBS and Non-native Packages with Orphan-packaging\n\nIn the orphan-packaging model (with separate packaging and development branches), packaging data is kept in a separate (orphan) branch with no source code or common history with the code development branches:\n\no---I---J---K---L         master (packaging)\n\n              F---G---H   development/master/1.0 (local source code changes)\n             /\no---A---B---C---D---E     upstream\n            |       |\n          v1.0    v2.0\n\n\nAll packaging data, including patches, is stored in the packaging branch. The development branch only contains upstream sources with no packaging data. The gbs devel command assists in working with the separate branches.\n\nDevelopers work on the development branch, making changes to the source code. When the package maintainer wants to release a new version of the package, they export changes (with gbs devel, 1 patch per commit) from the development branch to the packaging branch, commit the changes, update the change log, and submit a new version.\n\nWhen building/exporting the package, GBS creates a real upstream source tarball (similar to the joint-packaging model). Patches are auto-generated (and the spec file auto-modified) when working on the development branch. When working on the packaging branch, the packaging files are exported with no modifications.\n\nBuilding in the Joint-packaging Model\n\nFor GBS to see the package as non-native (which enables upstream source tarball and patch generation), you need to:\n\n\n  Have an upstream branch in the Git repository, with untouched upstream sources.\n  Have the upstream tag format configured correctly in the package-specific .gbs.conf file. The default is upstream/${upstreamversion}.\n  Have your development branch be based on the upstream version (indicated in the .spec file).\n  Have all your local manually maintained patches (in the packaging directory) applied to your development branch and removed from the packaging directory.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can have a pristine-tar branch in the Git repository for generating the upstream tarball with the pristine-tar tool.\n\nEdit, commit, and build code on your development branch. GBS handles the tarball and patch generation, as well as updating the .spec file. The following example demonstrates how GBS behaves in this situation (gbs export is being used as an example here for the truncated output):\n\n$ gbs export -o export\ninfo: Generating patches from git (v1.2.7..HEAD)\ninfo: Didn't find any old '%patch' macros, adding new patches after the last '%setup' macro at line %s\ninfo: Didn't find any old 'Patch' tags, adding new patches after the last 'Source' tag.\ninfo: zlib-1.2.7.tar.bz2 does not exist, creating from 'v1.2.7'\ninfo: package files have been exported to:\n/home/test/src/zlib/export/zlib-1.2.7-0\n\n\nWhen trying out the patch generation for the first time, first run the export command and examine the auto-updated spec file in the export directory to ensure that GBS updated it correctly. For information on manually maintained patches, see Manually Maintained Patches.\n\nThe upstream tarball and patch generation operation can fail for several reasons:\n\n\n  Upstream tag was not found\n    \n      Correct version is not present in the Git repository\n      Tag format is configured incorrectly\n    \n  \n  Current branch is not a descendant of the upstream version that it claims to be derived from\n\n\nBuilding in the Orphan-packaging Model\n\nIn order to use the orphan-packaging model with non-native packages, you need to:\n\n\n  Have an upstream branch in the Git repository, with untouched upstream sources.\n  Have the upstream tag format configured correctly in the package-specific .gbs.conf file. The default is upstream/${upstreamversion}.\n  Have an orphan packaging branch that only contains packaging files, including patches.\n  Have a development branch in which all patches have been applied on top of the upstream version.\n\n\nAgain, additionally, you can have a pristine-tar branch in the Git repository for generating the upstream tarball with the pristine-tar tool.\n\nCode development is done on the development branch: edit, commit, and build similarly to the joint-packaging model. However, all packaging changes are done in the packaging branch. And most importantly, submissions (releasing to integration) are done from the packaging branch. Before submitting, the package maintainer creates patches from the new changes in the development branch and commits these to the packaging branch. For more information on how to manage packaging and development branches, see gbs devel.\n\nManaging Upstream Sources\n\nTo maintain packages using the model described above, you need to keep unmodified upstream sources in a separate branch in your Git repository. GBS supports 2 models for this.\n\n\n  \n    Import upstream source archive to Git\n\n    In this model, you import source tarballs (or ZIP files) from the upstream release to your Git repository using the gbs import command. GBS commits the sources in the upstream branch and creates a tag for the upstream release. An example of starting from scratch, that is importing to an empty repo:\n\n    $ mkdir zlib &amp;&amp; cd zlib &amp;&amp; git init\n$ gbs import ../zlib-1.2.6.tar.gz\n...\n$ git branch\n* master\nupstream\n$ git tag\nupstream/1.2.6\n    \n\n    Now you can start development just by adding packaging files to the master branch. When you need to update to a newer upstream version, use the gbs import command again:\n\n    $ gbs import ../zlib-1.2.7.tar.gz\n$ git tag\nupstream/1.2.6\nupstream/1.2.7\n    \n\n    \n      Note\n\n      Currently, GBS automatically merges the new upstream version to your master branch. You need to update the version number in your spec file accordingly.\n    \n  \n  \n    Track the remote Git\n\n    In this model, you directly track a remote (Git) repository and the gbs import command is not used. GBS needs to know only the name of the upstream branch and the format of the upstream release tags. These are package-dependent information so you must configure them in a package-specific .gbs.conf in the master branch. For example, to start a package from scratch:\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/madler/zlib.git &amp;&amp; cd zlib\n$ git branch -m master origin # to keep origin tracking the upstream\n$ git checkout -b master\n$ vim .gbs.conf\n$ git add .gbs.conf &amp;&amp; git commit -m\"Add gbs.conf\"\n    \n\n    The example .gbs.conf configuration file is:\n\n    [general]\nupstream_branch = origin\nupstream_tag = v${upstreamversion}\n    \n  \n\n\nPristine-tar Support\n\nYou can use the pristine-tar for storing and checking out the upstream tarballs (see http://joeyh.name/code/pristine-tar/). You can install pristine-tar from the Tizen tools repository. The tool guarantees that the tarball generated by GBS is bit-identical to the real upstream release source tarball. GBS uses pristine-tar automatically if you have it installed on your system. If you use gbs import to manage the upstream sources, it automatically commits new tarballs to the pristine-tar branch.\n\n\n  Note\n\n  The use of the pristine-tar tool is optional, but highly recommended.\n\n\nHowever, if you track a remote upstream repository directly, you need to commit the upstream source tarballs to the pristine-tar branch manually. For example:\n\n$ cd zlib\n$ git branch\n* master\norigin\n$ pristine-tar commit ../zlib-1.2.7.tar.gz v1.2.7\n$ git branch\n* master\norigin\npristine-tar\n\n\nConverting an Existing Repository to a Non-native Package\n\nTo convert an existing repository to a non-native package:\n\n\n  An upstream branch is required:\n    \n      If you are already tracking the upstream, just configure the upstream branch name and tag format in the package-specific .gbp.conf file.\n      If not, import the upstream source tarball with gbs import or add the upstream remote to your repository and start tracking that.\n        \n          Tip:\n\n          If you are tracking the upstream Git directly, consider running the pristine-tar commit &lt;tarball&gt; &lt;upstream-tag&gt; command.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Rebase your current development branch on the correct upstream version (that is, rebase on the upstream tag).\n  Remove all local patches: apply and commit them on top of your development branch and then remove the patches from the packaging directory and preferably from the spec file, too.\n  Optionally, if you want to maintain the package using the orphan-packaging model, you can create the packaging and development branches using the gbs devel convert command.\n\n\nAdvanced Usage\n\n\nManually Maintained Patches\n\nGBS supports patches that are maintained manually, outside the automatic patch generation. This can be needed for architecture-dependent patches, for example, as GBS patch generation does not yet support conditional patches. Another example are patches that are applied on top of a secondary source tree, whose sources are not maintained in your Git tree, but only as a tarball in your packaging directory.\n\nTo use this feature, you must have your patches in the packaging directory and listed in the spec file. In addition, you must mark the patch to be ignored by the patch generation/importing by putting the # Gbp-Ignore-Patches: &lt;patch numbers&gt; line into the spec file. This makes GBS ignore the Patch: tags and %patch macros of the listed patches when importing or generating patches. An excerpt of an example spec file:\n\n...\nSource0: %{name}-%{version}.tar.bz2\n# Gbp-Ignore-Patches: 0\nPatch0: my.patch\n\n%description\n...\n\n\nThe Gbp-Ignore-Patches marker can be placed anywhere in the file, and is case-insensitive. The GBP prefix comes from git-buildpackage (gbp), which is used by GBS as the backend for patch generation.\n\n\n  Note\n\n  Pay attention to patch generation when building or exporting. The gbs import tool also ignores patches marked for manual maintenance when importing source RPMs.\n\n\nPatch Macro Location\n\nGBS tries to automatically find the correct location to add the %patch macros in the spec file when updating it with the newly generated patches. This is usually successful, but GBS can also guess wrong. You can manually mark the location for auto-generated %patch macros by adding a # Gbp-Patch-Macros marker line into the spec file:\n\n...\n%prep\n%setup\n# do things here...\n\n# Gbp-Patch-Macros\n\n# do more things here...\n\n%build\n\n\nGBS places the new %patch macros after the marker line. This marker is case-insensitive, similar to # Gbp-Ignore-Patches.\n\nSquashing Commits\n\nWhen generating patches, GBS supports squashing several commits into 1 monolithic diff. Currently, you can only squash from upstream-tag up to a given commit-ish. An example use case is squashing commits from an upstream release up to a stable update into a single diff (commits on top of the stable generate multiple patches normally). You can enable this with the squash_patches_until config file option or with the --squash-patches-until command line option: the format for the option is &lt;commit-ish&gt;[:&lt;filename-base&gt;].\n\nFor example:\n\n$ git branch\n* master\nstable\nupstream\n$ gbs export --squash-patches-until=stable:stable-update\ninfo: Generating patches from git (upstream/0.1.2..HEAD)\ninfo: Squashing commits a2a7d82..9c0f5ba into one monolithic 'stable-update.diff'\ninfo: Didn't find any old 'Patch' tags, adding new patches after the last 'Source' tag.\ninfo: Didn't find any old '%patch' macros, adding new patches after the last '%setup' macro\ninfo: mypackage-0.1.2.tar.gz does not exist, creating from 'upstream/0.1.2'\ninfo: package files have been exported to:\n/home/user/src/mypackage/packaging/mypackage-0.1.2-1.21\n\n\n\n  Note\n\n  If you are planning to use this feature, configure it in the package-specific .gbs.conf file. This way, all users (including the automatic build machinery) build and export the package in a similar way.\n\n",

            "content": "GBS Configuration\n\nThe GBS configuration files are all simple INI-style files that record various choices and settings used by many GBS commands. Some settings represent purely personal preferences, while others are vital to a correctly-functioning build, and still others simply tweak command behavior a little.\n\n\n  Note\n\n  .conf is a common extension for an INI file, an informal standard for configuration files. INI files are simple text files with a basic structure composed of sections and properties. Like many tools, GBS supports a hierarchy of configuration files, which are shown below in decreasing precedence:\n  \n    $PWD/.gbs.conf: project-specific configuration settings that affect only the specific project in the specified working directory. These settings have the highest precedence.\n    /home/&lt;user&gt;/.gbs.conf: user-specific configuration settings that affect only the specified user.\n    /etc/gbs.conf: system-wide configuration settings that affect the entire system. These settings have the lowest precedence.\n  \n\n\nWhen specifying the configuration file by using the -c (--config) option, 1 of the above files is loaded and applied by GBS. If no configuration file can be found, GBS automatically generates a ~/.gbs.conf file. To specify a file among a hierarchy of configuration files:\n\n$ gbs -c ~/gbs-my.conf build -A ...\n\n\nProfile-oriented Configuration Style\n\nThis section provides information about the profile-oriented style in a GBS configuration file.\n\nBasic Structure\n\nThe basic structure of a configuration file is composed of properties and sections:\n\n\n  Properties\nThe basic element contained in a configuration file is a property. Every property has a name and a value, delimited by an equal sign (=). The name appears to the left of the equal sign.\n  Sections\nProperties can be grouped into various sections, named according to the naming conventions. The section name appears on a line by itself in square brackets ([ ]). All the properties after the section declaration are associated with that section. No explicit “end of section” delimiter is needed. Sections end at the next section declaration or the end of the file. Possible sections include:\n    \n      \n        General section\nThe default profile is defined in the general section and affect GBS behavior on a general basis. That is, upon the modification of the general section, all GBS behaviors are changed accordingly.\n\n        The supported properties include:\n        \n          native\nThis property explicitly defines whether a package is native or non-native. Values yes, on, 1, true, and enabled are interpreted as True, directing GBS to export in the native packaging mode. All other non-empty values are interpreted as False, making GBS export in the non-native mode.\n          fallback_to_native\nThis property serves as an emergency option for non-native packages. When enabled for non-native packages, it forces GBS to fallback to the native packaging mode if export fails in the non-native packaging mode. This means that it directs GBS to ignore the upstream branch and create a tarball from HEAD (by default) or specified commit without generating any patch.\n          tmpdir\n          upstream_branch\n          upstreamtag\n          buildroot\n          packaging_dir\n        \n      \n      \n        Profile section\nSet common authentication information on the profile level, instead of repeating identical configurations in various sections. These settings can be automatically passed to OBS and repository sections.\n\n        Add authentication information to a specific repository or OBS section only when it is unique to the corresponding OBS or repository. In addition, multiple profile sections can exist in 1 configuration file, enabling the manipulation of GBS behaviors aimed at different devices (for example, mobile phone and IVI) in a central configuration file. For more information, see Configuring Multiple Profiles.\n\n        The supported properties include:\n        \n          user\n          passwd\n          repos\n          obs\n          buildconf\nThe build config for the gbs buildcommand to build all profiles.\n          exclude_packages\nA list of packages that do not participate in the building. This property can also be used to break the dependency circle.\n        \n      \n      OBS section\nThe OBS section specifies the configurations of the remote build server for a remote build. The supported properties include url, user, and password.\n      Repository section\nAs with the profile section, multiple repository sections can exist in 1 configuration file, allowing various repositories to be manipulated in “batch”. The supported properties include url, user, and password. The user and password properties can be omitted if the corresponding repository does not need authentication information.\n    \n  \n\n\n\nNaming Conventions\n\nThe section names must follow these naming conventions:\n\n\n  Name the general section exactly as [general].\n  Start the profile section name with “profile.”. For example, [profile.tizen] or [profile.IVI].\n  Start the OBS section name with “obs.”. For example, [obs.tizen].\n  Start the repository section name with “repo.”.\n\n\n[general]\n#Current profile name which must match a profile section name\ntmpdir = /var/tmp\neditor =\npackaging_branch = master\nupstream_branch = upstream\nupstream_tag = upstream/${upstreamversion}\npackaging_dir = packaging\nprofile = profile.tizen\nbuildroot = ~/GBS-ROOT/\nwork_dir = .\n\n[profile.tizen]\nobs = obs.tizen\nrepos = repo.tizen_latest\n# If no buildroot for profile, the buildroot in general section will be used\nbuildroot = ~/GBS-ROOT-profile.tizen/\n# Specify build conf for a specific profile by using shell-style variable references\nbuildconf = ${work_dir}/tizen-conf/build.conf\n# Specify a list of packages that don't participate in the building, which\n# can also be used to break dependency circle\nexclude_packages=filesystem,aul,libmm-sound,libtool\n\n# Common authentication information\nuser = xxx\npasswd = xxx\n\n[obs.tizen]\nurl = https://api.tizen.org\n\n\nConfiguration Specification\n\nThis section provides information about the configuration specification.\n\nConfiguring Common Properties\n\nTypical common properties include buildroot, user, and password.\n\nTo configure the buildroot property to override the default ~/GBS-ROOT value:\n\nbuildroot=&lt;New_Build_Root&gt;\n\n\nThe reason you need to configure the passwd property is because the password line is automatically converted to an encoded version after running the GBS:\n\npasswdx = QlpoOTFBWSZTWVyCeo8AAAKIAHJAIAAhhoGaAlNOLuSKcKEguQT1\n\n\nTo reset the password, delete the passwdx line above and add a new assignment equation:\n\npasswd=&lt;New_Password&gt;\n\n\n\nConfiguring Multiple Profiles\n\nBy adding configuration specifications of multiple profiles aimed at various devices in 1 configuration file, the GBS behavior oriented for a variety of devices can be manipulated by using a central configuration file.\n\nTo configure multiple profiles:\n\n[general]\nprofile = profile.ivi\n\n[profile.mobile]\n...\n[profile.ivi]\n...\n\n\nWhen you specify the profile section with the -P (--profile) option in a GBS command, the specified profile configuration is applied:\n\n$ gbs build --profile=profile.mobile -A i586\n$ gbs remotebuild --profile=mobile\n\n\nConfiguring a Repository\n\nYou can configure a repository to adapt the GBS build. The repository configuration specification starts with the section declaration named “[repo.]\", and is followed by various properties, including:\n\n\n  \n    url\n\n    The url property specifies the URL of a remote repository, or the full path of a local or remote repository. The following 2 types of remote repositories are supported:\n\n    \n      Standard RPM repository that has a repodata/ subdirectory under the /repos/ directory.\n      Tizen repository that has a builddata/ subdirectory, for example, http://download.tizen.org/releases/daily/2.0alpha/common/latest/.\n    \n\n    \n      Note\n\n      To guarantee the quality of the GBS build, the release folder must be used instead the snapshot folder.\n    \n  \n  \n    user\n  \n  \n    passwd\n  \n\n\n[repo.tizen_latest]\nurl = http://download.tizen.org/releases/trunk/daily/ivi/latest/\nuser = xxx\npasswd = xxx\n[repo.my_local]\n#local repo must be an absolute path\nurl = &lt;Full_Path_of_Local_Repository&gt;\n\n\nShell-style Variable References\n\nProperties defined in the [general] section can be directly used in other sections by using shell-style variable references in GBS 0.17 and higher:\n\n[general]\ntmpdir=/var/tmp\nwork_dir=~/test\n[profile.tizen]\nbuildconf=${work_dir}/tizen.conf\nbuildroot=${tmpdir}/profile.tizen/\n\n",

The following lists guidelines for designing new gestures for your apps.\n\n\n  \n    DO NOT use the basic touch gestures defined in this guideline for different actions.\n    DO NOT assign custom gestures for the basic actions that already have common gestures assigned to them.\n  \n\n\nThe basic touch gestures provided with the Tizen SDK will work just fine with most of the apps you design. However, if you are designing unique apps such as games, you may want to invent more creative touch interactions.\n\nAlso, provide appropriate feedback for all interactions to make your app responsive.\n\nThe following table lists the basic Tizen gestures you can use to offer intuitive touch interactions.\n\n \n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Symbol\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Tap\n      \n      Selects an item or executes functions if the area has no other touch interaction applied.\n    \n    \n      Double tap\n      \n      Zooms in to the predefined view level. Returns to default view level in zooming (if already zoomed in).\n    \n    \n      Touch and hold\n      \n      Executes specific functions. On the Home screen, enters edit mode. In apps, selects text.\n    \n    \n      Swipe / Flick\n      \n      Swipe is used to scroll through a list of items or to pan the screen.                                                                                           Flick is a quick swipe. It is used to quickly scroll through a list of items or to quickly pan the screen.\n    \n    \n      Drag and drop\n      \n      Touching, holding, and then dragging an object moves it to the desired location when the user releases his or her finger.\n    \n    \n      Zoom in\n      \n      Touching two fingers to the screen and spreading them apart zooms in on the screen.\n    \n    \n      Zoom out\n      \n      Touching two fingers to the screen and pinching them together zooms out on the screen.\n    \n  \n\n",

            "title": "Getting Started",
            "content": "Getting Started with EFL UI Programming\n\nThis topic explains how to start EFL UI programming. If you first want to learn what EFL is and how it works, see Introduction. If you want to create a first application step by step, see Creating Your First Tizen Mobile Native Application or Creating Your First Tizen Wearable Native Application.\n\nRunning EFL Applications\n\nThe first thing you need to do for EFL UI programming is to set the application to a basic condition, in which you can use EFL libraries and run the application life-cycle. In Tizen, managing the application life-cycle is supported by the Application framework, and it handles the basic steps of running EFL as well. It enables you to configure application properties, and manage application data, runtime environment, and behavior.\n\nThe following code snippet shows what the EFL UI application looks like in Tizen:\n\n#include &lt;app.h&gt;\n#include &lt;Elementary.h&gt;\n\nstatic bool\napp_create(void *data)\n{\n    /* Here comes your application code */\n}\n\nint\nmain(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    event_callback.create = app_create;\n    ret = ui_app_main(argc, argv, &amp;event_callback, &amp;ad);\n\n    return ret;\n}\n\n\nIn the above code, a header file (Elementary.h) is included. The Elementary library is a high-level wrapper of EFL, and you can use other EFL libraries, such as Evas, Ecore, and Edje, by including the Elementary header. The ui_app_main() function runs the application.\n\nTo run an Elementary application, you must initiate, run, and terminate the Elementary main loop. You cannot see the code in the template though, since it is hidden in a higher-layer library (application framework). The following code snippet shows the main function of a minimal Elementary application:\n\n#include &lt;Elementary.h&gt;\n\nint\nmain(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    elm_init(argc, argv);\n    /* Here comes your application code */\n    elm_run();\n    elm_shutdown();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nTo use the Elementary library:\n\n\n  Initialize the Elementary library with the elm_init() function.\n  Start the Elementary main loop with the elm_run() function. The function does not return and constantly loops and runs the event and processing tasks.\n  When your application terminates, shut down the Elementary library with the elm_shutdown() function. The function frees the Elementary objects that were allocated in the main loop, so you do not need to separately deallocate them.\n\n\nStarting from a Window\n\nEFL UI programming starts from adding a window. Basically, the way to build an EFL UI application is by adding a window and setting content in it.\n\nThe window is the bottommost UI component in an EFL application. Usually, when an application is launched, a window that fits into the device screen is created and shown.\n\nFigure: Empty window\n\n\n\nWindows are provided by the Elementary library. Since Elementary is a high-level wrapper on the topmost layer in the EFL hierarchy, you can start EFL UI programming with the Elementary library and expand the scope to lower-level libraries, as needed.\n\nThe following code snippet shows how to add a window:\n\nEvas_Object *win;\n\nwin = elm_win_util_standard_add(PACKAGE, PACKAGE);\nelm_win_autodel_set(win, EINA_TRUE);\nevas_object_show(win);\n\n\nFor a detailed explanation on the data type and APIs, see Programming Principles.\n\nBuilding a User Interface\n\nAfter adding a window, you need to fill the window with content. Usually, a window is filled with a UI container and the container is filled with another UI container or UI components. Building a user interface is basically a process of stacking UI components on top of each other in layers.\n\nFigure: Window filled with content\n\n\n\nA conformant is a UI container, which adjusts its size when a virtual keypad becomes visible. The following code snippet shows how to fill a window with a conformant container:\n\nwin = elm_win_util_standard_add(\"test\", \"Test\");\nconform = elm_conformant_add(win);\nelm_win_resize_object_add(win, conform);\n\n\nThe following code snippet shows how to fill the conformant container with content (in this case, a naviframe):\n\nconform = elm_conformant_add(win);\nnf = elm_naviframe_add(conform);\nelm_object_content_set(conform, nf);\n\n\nElementary provides a high-level toolkit for UI implementation. You can build a layout using UI containers and add UI components in it. Switching from one view to another and managing many views is also supported in the form of a UI component by Elementary. For more information, see Building UI Layouts and UI Components.\n\nEvas provides basic graphical objects and much more functionality related to rendering. You can create and manipulate primitive graphical objects, such as lines, rectangles, and images, using the Evas API. For more information, see Primitive Graphical Objects, Evas Rendering Concept and Method, and Transformation with Evas Map.\n\nEdje provides a much more flexible way to build a user-defined layout through EDC, which is a script language for layouting. Even though Elementary offers rich options to build various types of UIs, it only provides already defined UI containers. EDC supports advanced level of UI designing. For more information, see Layout and Layouting with EDC.\n\nManaging User Interactions and Visual Effects\n\nAfter arranging graphical elements, you can add a dynamic factor, such as user interaction or animation, in your application. EFL provides various event types that you can use to monitor and react to user input and system events in the UI. It also provides many animating methods.\n\n\n  \n    Elementary UI components define their own behavior internally, which includes visual effects or the response to user input. For example, lists are scrolled up and down according to touch events. Some of them provide animation options by API. For instance, labels have a slide function. Besides these, each UI component defines its own callback signal, so you can define the action triggered by the event. The following code snippet shows how to register a callback for the clicked signal of a button:\n\n    evas_object_smart_callback_add(button, \"clicked\", _button_clicked, NULL);\n\nstatic void\n_button_clicked(void *data, Evas_Object *obj, void *event_info)\n{\n    evas_object_smart_callback_del(obj, \"clicked\", _button_clicked);\n}\n    \n\n    For more information, see UI Components and Event Handling.\n  \n  \n    Evas provides handlers for low-level rendering events, as well as events related to a single object. The following code snippet shows how to register a callback for a mouse down event on a single rectangle object:\n\n    rect = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas);\nevas_object_event_callback_add(rect, EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_DOWN, _mouse_down_cb, NULL);\n    \n\n    For more information, see Evas Object Events.\n  \n  \n    Ecore is in charge of running the application main loop and related tasks, such as event handling, timer, and animator. For more information, see Core loop and OS Interfacing, Ecore Events, and Hardware Input Handling.\n  \n\n\nRelated Information\n\n  Dependencies\n    \n      Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile\n      Tizen 2.3.1 and Higher for Wearable\n    \n  \n\n",

            "content": "Graphics and UI\n\nThe application composes the graphic user interface by creating a window with a toolkit. The display server composites an application’s windows and shows the result on the screen. For this procedure, the graphics and UI middleware offers the following 3 modules for both client and server:\n\n\n  Tizen Buffer Manager (TBM)\n  Tizen Display Manager (TDM)\n  TPL-EGL\n\n\nFigure: Graphics UI diagram\n\n\n\nThe modules are hardware abstraction layers for graphics and UI. They allow the client and server to render with the GPU, share buffers with other processes, and organize hardware output devices for various chipsets. Their backend module needs to be implemented for the new hardware device.\n\n\n  TBM provides an abstraction interface for the Tizen graphic buffer manager.\n  TDM provides an abstraction interface for a display server, such as X or Wayland, to allow direct access to graphics hardware in a safe and efficient manner as a display HAL.\n  TPL-EGL is an abstraction layer for surface and buffer management on the Tizen platform aimed to implement the EGL™ porting layer of the OpenGL® ES driver over various display protocols.\n\n\nFor an application to handle input device events, the Input Manager is provided, and is mainly comprised of libinput and a thin wrapper around it. It handles input events in Wayland compositors and communicates with Wayland clients.\n\nBuffer Management\n\nTBM has a frontend library and a backend module. The TBM frontend library is hardware-independent and provides a generic buffer interface. On the other hand, the TBM backend module is hardware-dependent and provides a buffer interface dependent on the target system. Chipset vendors have to provide their own backend modules in order for TBM to work well on the Tizen platform. This is because the way each vendor manages the graphic buffers can be different between various chipset devices. TBM already has several reference backends, such as libtbm-dumb, and libtbm-shm.\n\nFigure: TBM backend\n\n\n\nWith TBM, the client and server can allocate buffers and share buffers between them. For example, a client allocates a graphic buffer, draws something on it with GL and sends it to the display server for displaying it on the screen without buffer copying. The TBM backend module is implemented as a shared library and the TBM frontend finds the libtbm-default.so file and loads it from the /usr/lib/bufmgr directory at runtime.\n\nsh-3.2# ls -al\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    14 Jul 28  2016 libtbm_default.so -&gt; libtbm_sprd.so\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    20 Jul 28  2016 libtbm_sprd.so -&gt; libtbm_sprd.so.0.0.0\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    20 Jul 28  2016 libtbm_sprd.so.0 -&gt; libtbm_sprd.so.0.0.0\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 26728 Jun 29  2016 libtbm_sprd.so.0.0.0\n\n\nInitialing the TBM Backend Module\n\nThe TBMModuleData is for the entry point symbol to initialize the TBM backend module. The TBM backend module must define the global data symbol with the name of tbmModuleData. The TBM frontend loads the tbmModuleData global data symbol and calls the init() function at the initial time.\n\n\n  Note\n\n  Do not change the name of the symbol in the TBM backend module.\n\n\n/*\n   @brief tbm module data\n   Data type for the entry point of the backend module\n*/\ntypedef struct {\n    TBMModuleVersionInfo *vers;\t/* TBM module information */\n    ModuleInitProc init; /* init function of a backend module */\n} TBMModuleData;\n\ntypedef int (*ModuleInitProc) (tbm_bufmgr, int);\n\n\nThe TBM backend module initialization consists of allocating the tbm_bufmgr_backend instance (tbm_backend_alloc), entering the necessary information, and the initialization itself (tbm_backend_init).\n\ntbm_bufmgr_backend tbm_backend_alloc(void);\nvoid tbm_backend_free(tbm_bufmgr_backend backend);\nint tbm_backend_init(tbm_bufmgr bufmgr, tbm_bufmgr_backend backend);\n\n\nMODULEINITPPROTO (init_tbm_bufmgr_priv);\n\nstatic TBMModuleVersionInfo DumbVersRec = {\n    \"shm\",\n    \"Samsung\",\n    TBM_ABI_VERSION,\n};\n\nTBMModuleData tbmModuleData = {&amp;DumbVersRec, init_tbm_bufmgr_priv};\n\nint\ninit_tbm_bufmgr_priv(tbm_bufmgr bufmgr, int fd) {\n    tbm_bufmgr_backend bufmgr_backend;\n\n    bufmgr_shm = calloc(1, sizeof(struct _tbm_bufmgr_shm));\n\n    bufmgr_backend = tbm_backend_alloc();\n\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;priv = (void *)bufmgr_shm;\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bufmgr_deinit = tbm_shm_bufmgr_deinit,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_size = tbm_shm_bo_size,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_alloc = tbm_shm_bo_alloc,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_free = tbm_shm_bo_free,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_import = tbm_shm_bo_import,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_import_fd = NULL,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_export = tbm_shm_bo_export,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_export_fd = NULL,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_get_handle = tbm_shm_bo_get_handle,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_map = tbm_shm_bo_map,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_unmap = tbm_shm_bo_unmap,\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_lock = NULL;\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;bo_unlock = NULL;\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;surface_get_plane_data = tbm_shm_surface_get_plane_data;\n    bufmgr_backend-&gt;surface_supported_format = tbm_shm_surface_supported_format;\n\n    if (!tbm_backend_init(bufmgr, bufmgr_backend)) {\n        tbm_backend_free(bufmgr_backend);\n        free(bufmgr_shm);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n}\n\n\nPorting the OAL Interface\n\nTBM provides the header files to implement the TBM backend module.\n\nTable: TBM backend module header files\n\n\n  \n    \n      Header file\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      tbm_bufmgr_backend.h\n      This file includes information on implementing the TBM backend module.\n    \n    \n      tbm_drm_helper.h\n      This file includes helper functions for the DRM interface backend module.\n    \n    \n      tbm_bufmgr.h\n      This is the user header file including general information on how to use the TBM.\n    \n    \n      tbm_surface.h\n      This is the user header file including general information on how to use tbm_surface.\n    \n  \n\n\nTBM Backend Interface\n\nThe following table lists the TBM backend interface functions for initializing and deinitializing.\n\nTable: Initializing and deinitializing functions\n\n\n  \n    \n      Function\n      Description\n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      ModuleInitProc()\n      The init function of a backend module.\n      Mandatory\n    \n    \n      bufmgr_deinit()\n      Deinitialize the buffer manager privately.\n      Mandatory\n    \n    \n      bufmgr_bind_native_display()\n      If the backend needs to get the native display, use this backend function.\n      Optional\n    \n  \n\n\nThe following table lists the TBM backend interface functions for tbm_bo.\n\nTable: tbm_bo functions\n\n\n  \n    \n      Function\n      Description\n      Mandatory\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      bo_alloc()\n      Allocates the buffer object.

The display server sometimes needs to convert or scale an image to a different size or format. To make it possible for various chipset devices, the display server needs the display hardware resource information and control over the resources. Tizen Display Manager (TDM) offers these functionalities for the display server with the unified interface for various chipset devices.\n\nFigure: TDM backend\n\n\n\nWith TDM, the display server can perform mode setting, DPMS control, and showing a buffer (framebuffer or video buffer) on the screen in the most efficient way. If the hardware supports the m2m converting and capture device, the display server can also convert an image and dump a screen including all hardware overlays with no compositing.\n\nThe vendor has to implement the TDM backend module. The TDM backend module has the responsibility to let the TDM frontend know the display hardware resource information. The display server gets this information and controls hardware devices through the TDM frontend APIs. TDM already has several backends for reference, such as libtdm-drm and libtdm-fbdev.\n\nThe TDM backend is implemented as a shared library. The TDM frontend finds the libtdm-default.so file and loads it in the /usr/lib/tdm directory at runtime.\n\nsh-3.2# ls -l /usr/lib/tdm\ntotal 40\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    14 Jul 28  2016 libtdm-default.so -&gt; libtdm-drm.so\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 37152 Jul 12  2016 libtdm-drm.so\n\n\nThe TDM backend module must define the global data symbol with the name tdm_backend_module_data. The TDM frontend reads this symbol at the initialization time. TDM calls the init() function of the tdm_backend_module_data. For more information, see tdm_backend.h.\n\ntypedef struct _tdm_backend_module {\n    const char *name; /* The module name of the backend module */\n    const char *vendor; /* The vendor name of the backend module */\n    unsigned long abi_version; /* The ABI version of the backend module */\n    tdm_backend_data *(*init)(tdm_display *dpy, tdm_error *error);\n    void (*deinit)(tdm_backend_data *bdata);\n} tdm_backend_module;\n\n\n#include &lt;tdm_backend.h&gt;\n\nstatic tdm_drm_data *drm_data;\n\ntdm_backend_data*\ntdm_drm_init(tdm_display *dpy, tdm_error *error) {\n    drm_data = calloc(1, sizeof(tdm_drm_data));\n\n    return (tdm_backend_data*)drm_data;\n}\n\nvoid\ntdm_drm_deinit(tdm_backend_data *bdata) {\n    free(bdata);\n}\n\ntdm_backend_module tdm_backend_module_data = {\n    \"drm\",\n    \"Samsung\",\n    TDM_BACKEND_SET_ABI_VERSION(1,1),\n    tdm_drm_init,\n    tdm_drm_deinit\n};\n\n\nThe TDM backend must register the tdm_func_display(), tdm_func_output(), and tdm_func_layer() functions with the tdm_backend_register_func_display(), tdm_backend_register_func_output(), and tdm_backend_register_func_layer() functions in the tdm_backend_module_data init() function.\n\n#include &lt;tdm_backend.h&gt;\n\ntdm_backend_data*\ntdm_drm_init(tdm_display *dpy, tdm_error *error) {\n    memset(&amp;drm_func_display, 0, sizeof(drm_func_display));\n    drm_func_display.display_get_capability = drm_display_get_capability;\n    drm_func_display.display_get_pp_capability = drm_display_get_pp_capability;\n    drm_func_display.display_get_outputs = drm_display_get_outputs;\n    drm_func_display.display_get_fd = drm_display_get_fd;\n    drm_func_display.display_handle_events = drm_display_handle_events;\n    drm_func_display.display_create_pp = drm_display_create_pp;\n    ret = tdm_backend_register_func_display(dpy, &amp;drm_func_display);\n    if (ret != TDM_ERROR_NONE)\n        goto failed;\n\n    memset(&amp;drm_func_output, 0, sizeof(drm_func_output));\n    drm_func_output.output_get_capability = drm_output_get_capability;\n\n    ret = tdm_backend_register_func_output(dpy, &amp;drm_func_output);\n    if (ret != TDM_ERROR_NONE)\n        goto failed;\n\n    memset(&amp;drm_func_layer, 0, sizeof(drm_func_layer));\n    drm_func_layer.layer_get_capability = drm_layer_get_capability;\n\n    ret = tdm_backend_register_func_layer(dpy, &amp;drm_func_layer);\n    if (ret != TDM_ERROR_NONE)\n        goto failed;\n\n    return (tdm_backend_data*)drm_data;\n}\n\n\nAfter loading the TDM backend module, the TDM frontend calls the display_get_capability(), display_get_outputs(), output_get_capability(), output_get_layers(), and layer_get_capability() functions to get the hardware-specific information. That means that the TDM backend module must implement these 5 functions.\n\nIn addition, if a target has a memory-to-memory converting hardware device and the capture hardware device, the TDM backend module can register the tdm_func_pp() and tdm_func_capture() functions with the tdm_backend_register_func_pp() and tdm_backend_register_func_capture() functions.\n\nPorting the OAL Interface\n\nTDM provides the header files to implement the TDM backend module.\n\nTable: TDM backend module header files\n\n\n  \n    \n      Header file\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      tdm_backend.h\n      This file defines the TDM backend interface.\n    \n    \n      tdm_log.h\n      This file includes functions to print logs in frontend and backend modules.\n    \n    \n      tdm_helper.h\n      This file includes helper functions for the TDM frontend and backend.\n    \n  \n\n\nThe display backend interface is mandatory.

The fullscreen buffer is set to the PRIMARY layer, and the small buffer is set to the OVERLAY layer.\n\nFigure: Tdm-test-server results\n\n\n\nChecking TDM Log Messages\n\nTDM uses dlog to print debug messages. To show TDM runtime log messages:\n\n$ dlogutil -v threadtime TDM\n\n\nReferences\n\nFor detailed information about TDM and the TDM backend, see Tizen Display Manager (TDM).\n\nInput Management\n\nThe input manager supports a libinput-based input device backend. libinput is a common input library for the Wayland compositor. With libinput, the input stack is simpler without the Xorg input drivers. Since Tizen 3.0, the input manager is not a HAL component.\n\nFigure: Tizen 3.0 input management\n\n\n\nlibinput\n\nThe libinput library handles input devices for display servers and other applications that need to directly deal with input devices:\n\n\n  Device detection\n  Device handling\n  Input device event processing\n  Scaling touch coordinates\n  Generating pointer events from touchpads\n  Pointer acceleration\n\n\nFor more information, see the libinput wiki.\n\nlibevdev\n\nThe libevdev library handles evdev kernel devices. It abstracts the evdev ioctls through type-safe interfaces and provides functions to change the appearance of the device.

The focus is on how graphical data buffers move through the system.\n\nThe Tizen platform requires the OpenGL® ES driver for the acceleration of the Wayland display server and the wayland-egl client. This platform demands an OpenGL® ES and EGL™ driver which is implemented by the Tizen EGL Porting Layer.\n\nTizen OpenGL® ES and EGL™ Architecture\n\nThe following figure illustrates the Tizen OpenGL® ES and EGL™ architecture.\n\nFigure: Tizen OpenGL® ES architecture\n\n\n\n\n  CoreGL\nAn injection layer of OpenGL® ES that provides the following capabilities:\n    \n      Support for driver-independent optimization (FastPath)\n      EGL™/OpenGL® ES debugging\n      Performance logging\n      Supported versions\n        \n          EGL™ 1.4\n          OpenGL® ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1\n        \n      \n    \n\n    CoreGL loads the manufacturer’s OpenGL® ES driver from the /usr/lib/driver directory. CoreGL provides the libEGL.so, libGLESv1_CM.so, and libGLESvs.so driver files in the /usr/lib directory.\n  \n  GPU vendor GL/EGL™ driver\nThe Tizen platform demands that the GPU vendor implements the GL and EGL™ driver using libtpl-egl. The GPU vendor GL/EGL™ driver (libEGL.so, libGLESv1_CM.so, libGLESv2.so) must be installed in the /usr/lib/driver path.\n\n\nTizen Porting Layer (TPL) for EGL™\n\nTPL-EGL is an abstraction layer for surface and buffer management on the Tizen platform. It is used for implementation of the EGL™ platform functions.\n\nFigure: TPL architecture\n\n\n\nThe background for the Tizen EGL Porting Layer for EGL™ is in various window system protocols in Tizen. There was a need for separating common layer and backend.\n\nTizen uses the Tizen Porting Layer for EGL™, as the TPL-EGL API prevents burdens of the EGL™ porting on various window system protocols. The GPU GL Driver’s Window System Porting Layer can be implemented by TPL-EGL APIs which are the corresponding window system APIs. The TBM, Wayland, and GBM backends are supported.\n\nTizen Porting Layer for the EGL™ Object Model\n\nTPL-EGL provides interfaces based on an object-driven model. Every TPL-EGL object can be represented as a generic tpl_object_t, which is reference-counted and provides common functions. Currently, display and surface types of TPL-EGL objects are provided. A display, like a normal display, represents a display system which is usually used for connecting to the server. A surface corresponds to a native surface, such as wl_surface. Surfaces can be configured to use N-buffers, but are usually double-buffered or triple-buffered. A buffer is what you render on, usually a set of pixels or a block of memory. For these 2 objects, the Wayland, GBM, TBM backend are defined, and they correspond to their own window systems. This means that you do not need to care about the window systems.\n\nThe TPL-EGL has the following core objects:\n\n\n  TPL-EGL Object\nBase class for all TPL-EGL objects.\n  TPL-EGL Display\nEncapsulates the native display object (Display *, wl_display). Like a normal display, this represents a display system which is usually used for connecting to the server, scope for other objects.\n  TPL-EGL Surface\nEncapsulates the native drawable object (Window, Pixmap, wl_surface). The surface corresponds to a native surface, such as tbm_surface_queue or wl_surface. A surface can be configured to use N-buffers, but they are usually double-buffered or triple-buffered.\n\n\nTPL-EGL Objects and Corresponding EGL™ Objects\n\nBoth TPL-EGL and vendor OpenGL® ES/EGL™ driver handles a tbm_surface as the corresponding TPL surface buffer. It is represented by the TBM_Surface part in the following figure.\n\nFigure: TPL-EGL architecture\n\n\n\nThe following figure illustrates the OpenGL® ES drawing API flow.\n\nFigure: OpenGL® ES drawing API flow\n\n\n\nTPL-EGL Frontend API\n\nTPL-EGL Object is a base class for all TPL-EGL objects. It provides common functionalities to all TPL-EGL objects.\n\nTable: TPL-EGL Object functions\n\n\n  \n    \n      Function\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      tpl_object_reference()\n      Increases the reference count of a TPL-EGL object. All TPL-EGL objects are reference-counted with a reference count 1 on creation. When the reference count drops to 0, the object is freed.\n    \n    \n      tpl_object_unreference()\n      Decreases the reference count and destroys the object if it becomes 0.\n    \n    \n      tpl_object_get_reference()\n      Gets the reference count of the given TPL-EGL object.\n    \n    \n      tpl_object_get_type()\n      Gets the type of the object (display, surface, or buffer).\n    \n    \n      tpl_object_set_user_data()\n      Sets the user data to a TPL-EGL object. If the user wants to relate some data with a TPL-EGL object, this function allows them to register a pointer to such data, which can be retrieved later using the tpl_object_get_user_data() function. The key is the pointer value itself as a key.\n    \n    \n      tpl_object_get_user_data()\n      Gets the registered user data of a TPL-EGL object.\n    \n  \n\n\nTPL-EGL Display encapsulates the native display object (Display *, wl_display). Any other objects created from TPL-EGL Display inherit its backend type.\n\nTable: TPL-EGL Display functions\n\n\n  \n    \n      Function\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      tpl_display_create()\n      Creates the TPL-EGL display object for the given native display if there is no existing TPL-EGL display for that native display. If given NULL for native_dpy, this function returns the default display.\n    \n    \n      tpl_display_get()\n      Gets the TPL-EGL display object for the given native display if one exists for it.\n    \n    \n      tpl_display_get_native_handle()\n      Gets the native display handle which the given TPL-EGL display is created for.\n    \n    \n      tpl_display_query_config()\n      Queries the supported pixel formats for the given TPL-EGL display. If any pixel format values are acceptable, use the TPL_DONT_CARE value for the size values .\n    \n    \n      tpl_display_filter_config()\n      Filters the configuration according to a given TPL-EGL display. This function modifies current config specific to the current given TPL-EGL display.\n    \n    \n      tpl_display_get_native_window_info()\n      Queries information on the given native window.\n    \n    \n      tpl_display_get_native_pixmap_info()\n      Queries information on the given native pixmap.\n    \n    \n      tpl_display_get_buffer_from_native_pixmap()\n      Gets the native buffer from the given native pixmap.\n    \n  \n\n\nTPL-EGL Surface encapsulates the native drawable object (Window, Pixmap, wl_surface). The main features of the class are retrieving the buffer for a frame and posting the surface to a screen.\n\nTable: TPL-EGL Surface functions\n\n\n  \n    \n      Function\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      tpl_surface_create()\n      Creates a TPL-EGL surface for the given native surface.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_get_display()\n      Gets the TPL-EGL display where the given TPL-EGL surface was created from.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_get_native_handle()\n      Gets the native surface handle of the given TPL-EGL surface.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_get_type()\n      Gets the type of the given TPL surface.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_get_size()\n      Gets the current size of the given TPL-EGL surface. The size of a surface can change when a user or the server resizes the window. TPL-EGL updates the size information every time when a buffer is queried using the tpl_surface_dequeue_buffer() function. Note that there can still be mismatch between actual surface size and the cached one.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_validate()\n      Validates the current frame of the given TPL-EGL surface. Call this function before getting the final render target buffer, as calling the tpl_surface_dequeue_buffer() function after calling this function can give output values different to earlier ones. A buffer returned after calling this function is guaranteed not to change further.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_dequeue_buffer()\n      Gets the buffer of the current frame for the given TPL-EGL surface. Depending on the backend, communication with the server can be required. Returned buffers are used for rendering the target to draw the current frame. Returned buffers are valid until the next tpl_surface_dequeue_buffer() function call. If the tpl_surface_validate() function returns TPL_FALSE, the previously returned buffers must no longer be used. Instead, this function must called again before drawing, returning a valid buffer.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_enqueue_buffer()\n      Posts a given tbm_surface. This function requests the display server to post a frame. This is the function which can enqueue a buffer to the tbm_surface_queue. Make sure this function is called exactly once for a frame. Scheduling post calls on a separate thread is recommended.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_enqueue_buffer_with_damage()\n      Posts a given tbm_surface with region of damage. Damage information is used for reducing number of pixels composited in the compositor. Setting the num_rects to 0 or rects to NULL means entire area is damaged. This function requests a server to post a frame. This function is identical with the tpl_surface_enqueue_buffer() function except for delivering the damage information for updating. Make sure this function is called exactly once for a frame. Scheduling post calls on a separate thread is recommended.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_set_post_interval()\n      Sets the frame interval of the given TPL-EGL surface, which ensures that only a single frame is posted within the specified vsync intervals. When a frame ends, the frame interval is set to the surface’s current interval.\n    \n    \n      tpl_surface_get_post_interval()\n      Gets the frame interval of the given TPL-EGL surface.\n    \n  \n\n\nThe following code snippet shows a simple example of the Tizen Porting Layer:\n\ndpy = tpl_display_create(...);\nsfc = tpl_surface_create(dpy, ...);\n\nwhile (1) {\n    buf = tpl_surface_dequeue_buffer(sfc);\n\n    /* Draw something */\n\n    tpl_surface_enqueue_buffer(sfc, buf);\n}\n\n\nIn the GPU vendor driver, the GPU frame builder handles the drawing. TPL-EGL exposes the native platform buffer identifiers and managers so that the buffer can be used in other modules. Currently, dma_buf/DRM is supported for these purposes. The EGL porting layer calls TPL-EGL functions to execute commands requested of it, and returns the results to the GPU vendor driver. TPL-EGL performs all protocol-dependent actions. Such protocol-dependent parts can be separated into TPL-EGL backends. TPL-EGL backend can also be configured at runtime, and you can specify which type of backend to use when initializing a display object.\n\nTPL-EGL and Wayland Server and Client\n\nTizen uses the wl_tbm protocol instead of wl_drm. The wl_tbm protocol is designed for sharing the buffer (tbm_surface) between the wayland_client and wayland_server. Although the wayland_tbm_server_init and wayland_tbm_client_init pair is a role for the eglBindWaylandDisplayWL, the EGL™ driver is required to implement the entry points for the eglBindWaylandDisplayWL and eglUnbindWaylandDisplayWL as dummy. For more information, see https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/docs/specs/WL_bind_wayland_display.spec.\n\nFigure: TPL-EGL and Wayland\n\n\n\nBuffer Flow Between the Wayland Server and OpenGL® ES/EGL™ Driver\n\nThe following figure shows the buffer flow between the Wayland server and the OpenGL® ES/EGL™ driver. The passed buffer is of the tbm_surface type.\n\nFigure: Buffer flow between Wayland server and OpenGL® ES/EGL™ driver\n\n\n\nProject Git Repository\n\nThe following table lists the available project Git repositories.\n\nTable: Git repositories\n\n\n  \n    \n      Project\n      Repository\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      libtpl-egl\n      platform/core/uifw/libtpl-egl\n      Tizen Porting Layer for EGL™\n    \n    \n      libtbm\n      platform/core/uifw/libtbm\n      Library for the Tizen Buffer Manager\n    \n    \n      coregl\n      platform/core/uifw/coregl\n      Injection layer of OpenGL® ES / EGL™\n    \n    \n      wayland-tbm\n      platform/core/uifw/wayland-tbm\n      Protocol for graphics memory management for Tizen\n    \n    \n      emulator-yagl\n      platform/adaptation/emulator/emulator-yagl\n      OpenGL® ES / EGL™ driver for the emulator\n    \n    \n      tpl-novice\n      platform/core/uifw/ws-testcase\n      Novice test framework for TPL\n    \n  \n\n\nlibtpl-egl Reference Driver\n\nThe Emulator YAGL (OpenGL® ES / EGL™ driver for the emulator) is implemented by libtpl-egl.\n\nThe following commit explains how to port the driver with libtpl-egl from the traditional drm-based driver:\n\n\n  Porting YAGL to the Tizen platform https://review.tizen.org/gerrit/#/c/67921/\n\n\nTesting and Verifying the OpenGL® ES Driver\n\nThe Khronos OpenGL® ES CTS supports wayland-egl. libtpl-egl has a test case for the libtpl-egl.

            "content": "Iconography\n\n\n\nTizen uses simple icon designs with subtle shadows. The following are guidelines for designing icons that instantly deliver information at a glance.\n\nUse Icon Designs That Are Easy to Understand\n\nWhen you design icons, ensure that they are easily understood without any additional description. Where applicable, use universal designs that are familiar to users. It’s a good idea to perform a usability test on the icons after designing them.\n\nDo Not Copy Real Life Objects, Iconize them\n\nUse flat, simple designs to describe the main characteristics of an app. Design your icons to emphasize the shapes of objects so that they can be easily recognized, and match the style with the app icons that are displayed on the Home screen. Do not try to include realistic photos, detailed lines, or complicated shapes in your icons.\n\nPrepare Differently Sized Icons for OS and Device Compatibility\n\nDifferent Tizen platforms require different icon sizes. For example, mobile devices with a WVGA display and those with an HD display require icons in different sizes since Tizen SDK 2.4. Circular type wearable devices also require device-specific icon sizes.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Device\n      Resolution\n      Icon asset size\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Mobile\n      HD\n      118 x 118\n    \n    \n      Mobile\n      WQHD\n      236 x 236\n    \n    \n      Mobile\n      WVGA\n      81 x 81\n    \n    \n      Wearable\n      360 x 360\n      152 x 152\n    \n  \n\n\n\nApp Icons\n\nApp icons are important because they visually represent your app on the Home screen. App icons must be attractive enough to draw a user’s attention and they have to deliver meaningful information about your apps.\n\n\n\nExample of a Tizen app icon\n\nShape It in a Circle\n\nTizen’s system icons are displayed as circles. Although this requirement creates challenges in designing icons, the shape allows for a uniformity that ties different icons together for a consistent look and feel.\n\n\n\nOriginal circle concept, initial sketch\n\nIcon Colors and Background\n\nCarefully choose the icon background color when designing an icon for your app. The background color greatly affects the visibility of your icon. Since the icon will be used to distinguish your app, icons should be designed for easy recognition. An icon with a carefully selected background color makes your icon design easy to notice, no matter where you place it.\n\n \n\nYour icons should be visible against any background\n\nIcon Patterns in Tizen\n\nIcon always uses circle container. Avoid complicated shape.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Do\n      Don’t\n    \n  \n\n\nCicle container can not distorted or replaced to different shapes.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Do\n      Don’t\n    \n  \n\n\nPlace object on center. Do not place object around edge of container.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Do\n      Don’t\n    \n  \n\n\nTizen recommends soft gradient on container. Avoid solid color for background or disoriented gradient directions.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Do\n      Don’t\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Do\n      Don’t\n    \n  \n\n\nLighting starts from top and end at the bottom\n\n\n\nRecommended lightening\n\n\nInteractive Icons\n\nInteractive icons allow for instant actions, or provide additional information about the currently displayed content. The same principles for designing app icons apply for the interactive icon design: use simple lines and shapes. In Tizen, there are two types of interactive icons.\n\nAction Icons\n\nOn the screen, you can add an action bar and place ‘Refresh’, ‘Back’, ‘Expand’, or ‘Close’ action icons on it. Sometimes, text buttons, such as ‘Cancel’ and ‘Done’, may be added if applicable.\n\n \nAn example of floating action button\n\nHere are the basic requirements of action icons:\n\n\n  Style : Use pictographic icons that are simple and bold. Choose an appropriate line thickness for the design.\n  Color : Design the icons with foreground colors brighter than background colors. Use darker icons over light-colored themes.\n  Button status : Design icons for normal, pressed, and dim states.\n\n\nThe link below takes you to download the Tizen Action Bar Icon Pack. You can find the action icon examples scaled for various screen sizes. This package includes icons designed in Adobe® Photoshop® format, so that you can customize them for your own designs.\n\n\n  Download the Action Bar Icon Pack for Mobile app design and Wearable (PNG and PSD files)\n\n\nThe Tizen SDK also includes default action icons for turning on or off certain features and making selections. Refer to Checkbox Components and Radio Button for detailed information.\n\nInformative Icons\n\nUnlike action icons, informative icons are not touchable. They help users understand the content by providing self-explanatory visual information. In the examples below, the icons on the left of the call log categorize the type of call records as missed and received. On the other hand, the weather icon on the circular type wearable device in the example provides brief weather information at a glance.\n\n \nCall log icons categorize received, missed, and outgoing calls\n\n\nCustom Icons\n\nYou can also design app icons to match your brand identity. When you do this, however, we recommend that you follow the styles provided in Tizen 2.4 2D to maintain visual consistency with the system icons. Carefully choose the colors, size, and location of the icon and make sure that the icon is visible at all times.\n\nThe following are the basic requirements for brand icons:\n\n\n  Size : Sizes may vary. Choose a size that provides a good balance with the content on the screen.\n  Style : Use simple pictographic icons that are easy to understand. Do not apply outline strokes or shadows.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Do\n      Don’t\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Color : Design icons with colors that are easily noticeable. Use dark colors over light backgrounds and light colors over dark backgrounds to ensure optimal visibility.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Do\n      Don’t\n    \n  \n\n",

Make sure that the correct machine ID and the boot arguments are passed from the boot loader.\n\nAfter mounting the initial RAM disk image, initramfs hands over control to systemd as the Tizen platform system manager daemon. From this point, systemd is responsible for probing all remaining hardware, mounting all necessary file systems, and spawning all configured services. The system bootup process is split up into discrete steps. To synchronize point during start-up, target units (files whose names end in .target) are used for grouping units. The bootup process is highly parallelized in each target so that the order in which specific target units are reached is not determined. The system-plugin-slp is an OAL plugin for configuration settings, such as the mount point (/etc/fstab).\n\nThe following figure shows the early boot sequence after starting the kernel.\n\nFigure: Early boot sequence\n\n\n\n\n  sysinit.target\nSpecial target unit for early boot-up scripts. It has dependencies on necessary services and targets, such as local-fs.target. At this point, most of the file systems, such as /opt, /tmp, and /media, are mounted and the systemd-related daemons, such as systemd-journald, are launched.\n  basic.target\nSpecial target unit for basic bootup. At this point, all necessary initialization for general purpose daemons, such as mount points, sockets, timers, and path units, is completed. Tizen-specific services (such as vconf-setup and tizen-debug-level) are also executed.\n  bootmode.target\nSpecial target unit for selecting the boot mode. If the kernel boot parameter (/proc/cmdline) has the charger_detect_boot option passed by a boot loader, such as uboot, the platform boots up in charging mode. In this mode, the system enters the low power mode and charges the battery. If the charger_detect_boot option is not included as a kernel boot parameter, a normal boot is started.\n\n\nThe following figure shows the overview of normal booting sequence in Tizen platform.\n\nFigure: Tizen platform boot sequence\n\n\n\n\n  multi-user.target\nSpecial target unit for setting up a multi-user system with non-graphical support. On the Tizen platform, this target is used for launching platform infrastructure daemons, such as dbus (system session), power manager, GPS manager, telephony daemon, WRT (Web Run Time) security daemon, and the media server. Some systemd-related daemons (such as systemd-logind) are also started in this phase.\n  graphical.target\nSpecial target unit for setting up a graphical environment. Some important daemons (such as the access control and OMA DS agent servers) that must have root permission are launched at this point. The Tizen platform uses the systemd user session for App privilege daemons. Some daemons related to the graphics system, such as Enlightenment (window manager), are launched with the App privilege in this phase. The Tizen platform has its special target for middleware and mobile service: tizen-middleware.target starts the platform service daemons, such as calendar, contacts, email, message, sound, and download provider. tizen-mobile-session.target starts some service daemons related with the mobile session.\n\n\nBSP Customization\n\nThis section covers the basic configuration, setup, and build procedure required for building the boot loader and the kernel image for ARM.\n\nBoot Loader\n\nThe boot loader is a small piece of software that is needed to perform the basic hardware and peripheral initialization and load the kernel and proper device tree binary for the device to RAM. For the Tizen platform, the boot loader comes in 2 parts, the primary boot loader and the secondary boot loader. The primary boot loader is proprietary, and the secondary boot loader is the open source u-boot, customized for the Tizen platform.\n\nIf your platform is already loaded with the compatible boot loader software, you can skip this section and move directly to the kernel section.\n\nBoot Loader Setup and Build\n\nTo build the Tizen TM1 boot loader:\n\n\n  Install and set up cross-compile tools on your system if the host has a different architecture than the target (such as x86).\n  Start with cleaning up the u-boot-tm1 source. Download the source from the u-boot-tm1 repository.\n    $ make distclean`\n    \n  \n  Set up the configuration for TM1.\n  Build u-boot:\n    $ make ARCH=arm\n    \n  \n  Once the build is successful, the u-boot.bin file is created. (This step is for preventing from flashing the other u-boot.bin file.)\n    $ tools/mkimage_signed.sh u-boot.bin \"tizen_tm1\"\n    \n\n    After the script is run, the u-boot-mmc.bin file is created.\n  \n  Create a boot loader tarball to download the u-boot binary onto the target.\n    $ tar cvf bootloader.tar u-boot-mmc.bin`\n    \n    \n      Note\n\n      Be careful when modifying the boot loader: incorrect configuration can damage the device permanently.\n    \n  \n\n\nBoot Loader Kernel Parameters\n\nCommand line parameters, such as the following example, can be passed from the boot loader to the Linux kernel:\n\nconsole=ttyS1,115200n8\nmem=1024M\nloglevel=1\n\n\nKernel\n\nThe kernel is the operating system that drives the platform. In this case, the kernel refers to the open source Linux kernel that is customized for the Tizen platform. The following section gives a brief overview about the Tizen kernel setup, configuration, and the build procedure for building a Linux kernel for your Tizen platform. The output of the kernel binary is a uImage that is suitable only for a u-boot boot loader. If you have chosen a secure booting configuration in your boot loader, this uImage must be compatible with your boot loader.\n\nKernel Configurations\n\nTo download the Tizen kernel source package, see Getting Source Code and Build. To set up or modify your kernel configuration, use the appropriate defconfig file from arch/arm/configs/ (ARM CPU).\n\nFor more information on the Tizen kernel configuration and kernel building, see Kernel Build.\n\n\n  Note\n\n  Tizen uses INOTIFY instead of DNOTIFY. You must disable DNOTIFY from your kernel configuration.\n\n\nIf you want to use initramfs, you can use these configurations:\n\n\n  CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE\n  CONFIG_INITRAMFS_ROOT_UID\n  CONFIG_INITRAMFS_ROOT_GID\n  CONFIG_INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_NONE/GZIP/BZIP2/LZNA/LZO\n\n\nTizen File System\n\nVirtual Filesystem (VFS)\n\nThe virtual file system (VFS) is an abstraction layer on top of a physical file system (such as ext2, jfs, and ext4). The VFS provides a switching layer between the SCI (system call interface) and the file systems supported by the kernel, as shown in the following figure.\n\nFigure: Tizen file system\n\n\n\nAt the top of the VFS is a common API abstraction of functions, such as open, close, read, and write. At the bottom of the VFS are the file system abstractions that define how the upper-layer functions are implemented with respect to a specific file system.\n\nBelow the file system layer is the page cache, which provides a common set of functions to the file system layer (independent of any particular file system). This caching layer optimizes access to the physical devices by keeping data around for a short time (or speculatively reading ahead, so that the data is available when needed). Below the page cache are the device drivers, which implement the interface for the particular physical device.\n\nTizen Partition Layout\n\nThe following description is an example of the Tizen partition layout. The product vendor can modify the sequence or partition layout for their devices, as needed.\n\nFigure: Tizen partition layout\n\n\n\nThe boot partition is mounted in the /boot directory of rootfs. Here s-boot, u-boot, and the kernel image are saved as a file format, provided as system.tar.\n\n\n  The CSA (Configuration Saved Area) partition is for non-volatile data, such as the calibration value of modem.\n  The boot partition includes the kernel image, boot loader image, and modem image. Additionally, it can have device driver modules.\n  Third partition is reserved for the future.\n  The CSC (Customer Software Configuration) partition is mounted in the /mnt/csc directory. It can store the customer’s software configuration, such as the default language and time zone.\n  The platform partition is mounted on the root directory. It contains fundamental frameworks for Tizen and some general utility for Linux. It can be provided as a platform.img file.\n  The data partition is mounted in the /opt directory and it includes applications, libraries of applications, and the platform database. It can be provided as a data.img file.\n  The UMS (USB Mass Storage) partition is mounted in the /opt/media directory and it includes default (media) contents. It can be provided as ums.img.\n\n\nEach image file, platform.img, data.img, and ums.img can be zipped for downloading, for example, &lt;IMAGE_NAME&gt;.tar.gz.\n\nEach partition has the hierarchy illustrated in the following figure.\n\nFigure: Tizen file system hierarchy\n\n\n\nSupported File Systems\n\nTizen supports the Extended 4 (ext4) file system. The Tizen kernel has to be compiled to enable support for other file systems, such as JFS, XFS, BTRFS, and Reiserfs.\n\nThe Extended 4 (ext4) file system is configured as a default file system for Tizen.\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe following ext4 configuration options can be enabled in the kernel configuration file:\n\n\n  CONFIG_EXT4_FS=y\n  CONFIG_EXT4_FS_XATTR=y\n  CONFIG_EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT23=y\n  CONFIG_EXT4_FS_SECURITY=y\n\n\nMMC/SD/SDIO\n\nTizen supports MultiMediaCard, Secure Digital, and Secure Digital I/O Support. The MMC driver is implemented on top of a host controller (such as the SDHCI controller driver) and supports MMC, SD, SD High Speed, and SDHC cards.\n\nIf MMC is your booting device, read-write APIs, partition management, and flashing must be provided at the boot loader.\n\nFigure: Tizen MMC architecture\n\n\n\nThe MMC/SD/SDIO driver supports the following features:\n\n\n  Driver is built in-kernel\n  MMC cards, including high speed cards\n  SD cards, including SD high speed and SDHC cards\n\n\nThe MMC subsystem code structure in the kernel is located at /driver/mmc and divided into 3 parts:\n\n\n  MMC block device driver located at /driver/mmc/card/\n  Protocol stack for MMC, SD, SDIO located at /driver/mmc/core/\n  Host controller driver located at /driver/mmc/host/\n\n\nHotplug MMC Event Handling\n\nBased on the hotplug event handling, a notification is passed to deviced for device status changes. It detects, mounts, and monitors the status of the SD card.\n\nReference\n\nThe SDHCI controller is supported in the MMC/SD/SDIO interface. The Mobile Storage Host controller is only supported in the MMC interface.\n\n\n  Kernel configuration for MMC Interface\nCONFIG_MMC_BLOCK, CONFIG_MMC, CONFIG_MSHCI (for Mobile Storage Interface enable)\nsys interface: /dev/mmcblk0pX\n  Kernel configuration for SD/SDIO Interface\nCONFIG_MMC_BLOCK, CONFIG_MMC\nCONFIG_MMC_SDHCI (for SDHCI host Interface enable)\nCONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_S3C (for Samsung SoC)\nsys interface: /dev/mmcblk1pX\n\n\nThe X denotes the MMC partition number. Details of the partition mount point for Tizen are covered under Tizen Partition Layout.\n",

The GPS plugin is implemented as a shared library and the lbs-server loads a specific GPS plugin at runtime. A GPS plugin must be written with predefined interfaces.\n\nThe lbs-server-plugin-dev source package is installed on OBS by adding the following command in the package spec file:\n\nBuildRequires: pkgconfig(lbs-server-plugin)\n\n\nThe lbs-server-plugin-dev package source files can be found in the following directories:\n\n/usr/include/lbs-server-plugin/*.h\n/usr/lib/pkgconfig/lbs-server-plugin.pc\n\n\nThe gps_plugin_intf.h header file includes the API interfaces for the communication between the lbs-server and its GPS plugin.\n\ntypedef struct {\n    /* Initialize the plugin module and register callback function for event delivery */\n    int (*init) (gps_event_cb gps_event_cb, void *user_data);\n    /* Deinitialize the plugin module */\n    int (*deinit) (gps_failure_reason_t *reason_code);\n    /* Request specific action to plugin module */\n    int (*request) (gps_action_t gps_action, void *gps_action_data, gps_failure_reason_t *reason_code);\n} gps_plugin_interface;\n\n\nconst gps_plugin_interface *get_gps_plugin_interface();\n\n\nThe get_gps_plugin_interface() function must be exported in the GPS plugin. It gives the gps_plugin_interface structure to the lbs-server, and the lbs-server communicates through these interfaces. When the lbs-server is started, the GPS plugin is loaded and the init() function is called. At this moment, a GPS device must be initialized.\n\nint (*init) (gps_event_cb gps_event_cb, void *user_data);\n\n\nWhen the init() function is called, the gps_event_cb callback is set. GPS events and data from a GPS device are delivered through the callback.\n\ntypedef int (*gps_event_cb) (gps_event_info_t *gps_event_info, void *user_data);\n\n\nThe following example describes the GPS events:\n\ntypedef enum {\n    GPS_EVENT_START_SESSION = 0x0000, /* The session is started */\n    GPS_EVENT_STOP_SESSION, /* The session is stopped */\n    GPS_EVENT_CHANGE_INTERVAL, /* Change updating interval */\n    GPS_EVENT_REPORT_POSITION = 0x0100, /* Bring up GPS position data */\n    GPS_EVENT_REPORT_SATELLITE, /* Bring up GPS SV data */\n    GPS_EVENT_REPORT_NMEA, /* Bring up GPS NMEA data */\n    GPS_EVENT_SET_OPTION = 0x0200, /* The option is set */\n    GPS_EVENT_GET_REF_LOCATION = 0x0300, /* Get the reference location for AGPS */\n    GPS_EVENT_GET_IMSI, /* Get IMSI for identification */\n    GPS_EVENT_OPEN_DATA_CONNECTION = 0x0400, /* Request opening data network connection */\n    GPS_EVENT_CLOSE_DATA_CONNECTION, /* Request closing data network connection */\n    GPS_EVENT_DNS_LOOKUP_IND, /* Request resolving host name */\n    GPS_EVENT_AGPS_VERIFICATION_INDI, /* Verification indicator for AGPS is required */\n    GPS_EVENT_FACTORY_TEST = 0x0500,/* Factory test is done */\n    GPS_EVENT_ERR_CAUSE = 0xFFFF /* Some error is occurred */\n} gps_event_id_t;\n\n\nThe GPS events contain specific GPS event data which is part of the delivered gps_event_data_t (see the gps_plugin_intf.h file). When the lbs-server wants to make a request to a GPS device, the request() function is called:\n\nint (*request) (gps_action_t gps_action, void *gps_action_data, gps_failure_reason_t *reason_code);\n\n\nEach request is classified by gps_action_t.\n\ntypedef enum {\n    GPS_ACTION_SEND_PARAMS = 0x00,\n    GPS_ACTION_START_SESSION,\n    GPS_ACTION_STOP_SESSION,\n    GPS_ACTION_CHANGE_INTERVAL,\n    GPS_INDI_SUPL_VERIFICATION,\n    GPS_INDI_SUPL_DNSQUERY,\n    GPS_ACTION_START_FACTTEST,\n    GPS_ACTION_STOP_FACTTEST,\n    GPS_ACTION_REQUEST_SUPL_NI,\n    GPS_ACTION_DELETE_GPS_DATA,\n} gps_action_t;\n\n\nWith the standalone GPS (unassisted GPS), the GPS_ACTION_START_SESSION and GPS_ACTION_STOP_SESSION are mandatory actions. If the GPS_ACTION_START_SESSION is delivered, the GPS plugin starts the acquisition of satellites and reports the GPS_EVENT_START_SESSION event to the lbs-server through the gps_event_cb callback. Once the acquisition is completed and position is fixed, the position must be delivered by the gps_event_cb callback with the GPS_EVENT_REPORT_POSITION event ID and the position data.\n\nTo shut down the lbs-server, deinitialize the GPS device with the deinit() function:\n\nint (*deinit) (gps_failure_reason_t *reason_code);\n\n\nAdding a new GPS plugin\n\nThe check_plugin_module(char* module_name) function checks the access to the available plugin in the /sys/devices/platform directory and the load_plugin_module loads the plugin during the boot up time.\n\nAdd the necessary path definitions:\n\n#define PLATFORM_PATH \"/sys/devices/platform\"\n#define PLUGIN_PATH PLATFORM_PATH\"/xxxxx_gps\"\n\n\nGeofence\n\nThe Geofence Manager API provides a service related to geofence. A geofence is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area.\n\nFigure: Tizen geofence architecture\n\n\n\nYou can set a geofence based on a geopoint, a Wi-Fi MAC address, or a Bluetooth address. Notifications are provided for events, such as changes in the service status.\n\nThere are 2 kinds of places and fences:\n\n\n  Public places and fences that are created by the MyPlace application can be used by all applications.\n  Private places and fences that are created by a specific application can only be used by that same application.\n\n\nNotifications can be received about the following events:\n\n\n  Zone in event when a device enters a specific area\n  Zone out event when a device exits a specific area\n  Results and errors for each event requested by the geofence module\n\n\nMap Service\n\nThe Location Maps API (Maps API) allows you to create map-aware applications.\n\nFigure: Tizen Maps API\n\n\n\nThe Maps API has the following features:\n\n\n  Geocoder (geocoding and reverse geocoding)\n  Places (search places)\n  Routes (search directions)\n  Map Widget (rendering map images)\n\n\nThe Maps API allows you to select a map service provider to be included in the plugins.\n\nPorting the OAL Interface\n\nThe Maps plugin is implemented as a shared library and the Maps framework loads a specific Maps plugin at runtime.

The kernel interfaces to control codecs can be different for different chipsets, so the corresponding codec plugins must be implemented specifically for each chipset.\n\nFigure: Multimedia player framework\n\n\n\nPorting the OAL Interface\n\nThere is no specific OAL for the multimedia player framework. The OAL interface for the player plugins consists of the gst-omx codec plugins and video/audio renderer plugins. For more information on the gst-omx plugin, see Codec &gt; Porting OAL Interface. For more information about Avsystem for audio, see Audio. For more information on Wayland (UI-framework) for display, see Video.\n\nFigure: Player plugins\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\n  Configuration file:\n    \n      The multimedia player framework uses the mmfw_player.ini configuration file to set various parameters for selecting different codecs and display plugins.\n      The mmfw_player.ini configuration file is provided by the mmfw-sysconf-xxx package.\n      In the final stage of development, the permission for this file needs to be changed to read-only.\n    \n  \n  Configuring the player:\n    \n      File name: mmfw_player.ini\n      1 player.ini file is needed in each board (or model).\n      Codec plugins for the board are located in the /usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0 directory.

It shows 2 types of codec plugins, the Gstreamer and OpenMAX.\n\nFigure: Multimedia codecs\n\n\n\n\n  Gstreamer codec plugin\n    \n      The Gstreamer codec plugin can be linked to and easily used in the Gstreamer pipeline, which is used in the multimedia framework.\n      In addition, to link a Gstreamer pipeline, the capability of the codec plugin can be negotiated with the linked element in the pipeline.\n      To get detailed information, such as the capability of an element, use the #gst-inspect-1.0 (element name) command.\n\n    \n  \n  OpenMAX codec plugin\n    \n      Some of the codec vendors provide OpenMAX IL components and not Gstreamer plugins. Tizen provides the gst-omx plugins to use the OpenMAX IL components. The Gstreamer pipeline used in the multimedia framework can control and transfer data to OpenMAX IL component using the gst-omx plugin.\n      To use the OpenMAX component in Gstreamer, the gst-omx (open source) package is provided. By using this package, Gstreamer can recognize and use an OpenMAX component as a Gstreamer element. gst-omx is a Gstreamer plugin that allows communication with OpenMAX IL components. The usage of the gst-omx plugin is the same as other Gstreamer plugins.\n      For more detailed information about this plugin, see http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/GstOpenMAX. For more information about OpenMAX IL, see http://www.khronos.org/openmax/.\n      The gst-omx plugin refers to a gstomx.conf configuration file. This file is included in the gst-omx package, and installed to the /etc/xdg/gst-omx.conf directory in the target device.\n    \n  \n\n\nPorting the OAL Interface\n\nThe OpenMAX plugin is an industry standard that provides an abstraction layer for computer graphics, video, and sound routines. The interface abstracts the hardware and software architecture in the system. The OpenMAX IL API allows the user to load, control, connect, and unload the individual components. This flexible core architecture allows the Integration Layer to easily implement almost any media use case and mesh with existing graph-based media frameworks. The key focus of the OpenMAX IL API is portability of media components. OpenMAX IL interfaces between the media framework, such as GStreamer, and a set of multimedia components (such as an audio or video codecs). gst-omx is a GStreamer plug-in package that allows communication with OpenMAX IL components. The gst-omx structuring is classified into different object classes based on the functionality. The following figure shows the object structuring of a video decoder plugin in gst-omx.\n\nFigure: gst-omx structuring\n\n\n\nThe GstVideoDecoder base class for video decoders provides encoded data to derived GstOMXVideoDec. Each input frame is provided in turn to the subclass’s handle_frame callback. The GstVideoDecoder base class and derived subclass cooperate in the following manner:\n\n\n  Configuration\n    \n      GstVideoDecoder calls the start() function when the decoder element is activated.\n      GstVideoDecoder calls the set_format() function to inform the subclass of caps describing the input video data.\n    \n  \n  Data processing\n    \n      Each input frame is provided in turn to the subclass’s handle_frames() function.\n      The subclass calls the gst_video_decoder_finish_frame() or gst_video_decoder_drop_frame() function.\n    \n  \n  Shutdown phase\n    \n      The GstVideoDecoder class calls the stop() function.\n    \n  \n\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe gst-omx plugin uses a configuration file, such as gstomx.conf. This file is included in the gst-omx package, and installed in the /etc/xdg/gstomx.conf directory on the target device.

It is used with a camera or player that requires video output. This element can receive a surface ID of a window from the application through the GstVideoOverlay interface (set_wl_window_wl_surface_id()) and renders the video frame in this window. If no surface ID was provided by the application, the element creates its own internal window and renders into it.\n\nThe following figure shows the video rendering process in the player. The white box is the gstreamer element. GstBuffer is streaming from filesrc to Waylandsink past the video codec. The GstBuffer is TBM or SHM.\n\nFigure: Video rendering process\n\n\n\n\n  Waylandsink requests the rendering of the video frame to the wl_surface of a window, so Waylandsink needs the wl_surface of a Wayland window created by the application. Because the application and Muse are in different process bounds, the application cannot pass the wl_surface pointer to Muse. To solve this problem, Tizen uses the surface ID value.\n  The application sends a wl_surface pointer to the Window Server, which returns the global surface ID to the application, which in turn passes this value to Waylandsink using the GstVideoOverlay interface, set_wl_window_wl_surface_id() (Tizen-specific). Steps 1, 2, and 3 in the figure.\n  Waylandsink creates wl_display to communicate with the Window Server. Normally a Window client uses the wl_display created by the application, but the Tizen Waylandsink creates its own wl_display due to process bounds issues. Step 4. Now Waylandsink can receive events from the server and bind to various interfaces using wl_registry.\n  Waylandsink uses wl_display to create wl_window and a wl_subsurface using the global surface ID passed through the GstVideoOverlay interface. wl_surface is created by the wl_compositor of wl_display. Step 5.\n  The application can use the Waylandsink properties to change video rendering conditions through wl_subsurface. Step 6.\n  The GstBuffer received from the video codec is converted into a wl_buffer, then the wl_surface of wl_window is requested to render the video frame to the Window Server through the attach, damage, and commit process. Steps 7 and 8. The Window Server renders the wl_buffer. Step 9.\n  When the Window Server finishes rendering the video frame, the rendering complete signal is sent to the wl_callback of wl_window, and the wl_buffer release event is sent to the wl_buffer_listener callback function. Steps 10 and 11. Now, Waylandsink can unreference the GstBuffer created by the video codec and return the GstBuffer to the video codec. Sometimes, it is necessary to return a GstBuffer while maintaining the rendered video frame in the window (for gapless playback, or keeping a camera preview). In this case, use FlushBuffer, which is a wl_buffer created after copying TBM from GstBuffer coming from the video codec. Waylandsink returns the GstBuffer to the video codec immediately, and a request to render the FlushBuffer is made to the Window Server.\n\n\nFor more information on Wayland, see https://wayland.freedesktop.org/.  For more information on programming the Wayland client, see Programming Wayland Clients.\n\nPorting the OAL Interface\nThere is no specific OAL for the videosink.\n\nTizen-specific Features Added to Waylandsink\n\nYou can check the original waylandsink behavior easily with Waylandsink’s video rendering test. Simply connect to videotestsrc through gst-launch. If the video test screen does not appear, the Window system must be ported first.\n\ngst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! waylandsink\n\nFigure: Video test screen\n\n\n\nWaylandsink Requirements for Tizen\n\nOpen source Waylandsink uses wayland-client, but Waylandsink for Tizen uses libtbm, wayland-tbm-client, and tizen-extension-client to support MMFW’s API requirements and uses Window Server extended functionality.\n\nThe major functions are TBM Video Format, Specific Video Formats, Zero copy, MMVideoBuffer, Tizen Viewport, Flush Buffer, Audio only mode, Handoffs Element signals, preroll-handoff Element signals, Use TBM, Rotate, Flip, Visible, Display Geometry Method, and ROI.\n\nTBM Video Format\n\nOriginal Waylandsink lists various video formats, but Wayland only supports the RGB format. To support various video formats, Waylandsink for Tizen uses the TBM Video Format provided by Wayland for Tizen. The video formats supported by the Window Server are hardware-dependent. The dependency is on the Window Server. When the Gst-pipeline with Waylandsink is created and the caps negotiation begins, the TBM video format provided by the Window Server is passed to Waylandsink. The Window Server can accommodate the video output format of the video codec when the negotiation is completed.\n\nTo use the TBM Video Format, Waylandsink needs to bind tizen_policy_interface, tizen_video_interface, and register listener and get the video formats as a callback.\n\nstatic void handle_tizen_video_format(void *data, struct tizen_video *tizen_video, uint32_t format) {\n    GstWlDisplay *self = data;\n    FUNCTION;\n\n    g_return_if_fail(self != NULL);\n\n    GST_LOG(\"format is %d\", format);\n    g_array_append_val(self-&gt;tbm_formats, format);\n}\n\nstatic const struct tizen_video_listener tizen_video_listener = {\n    handle_tizen_video_format\n};\n\nstatic void global_registry_handler(void *data, struct wl_registry *registry, uint32_t id, const char *interface, uint32_t version) {\n    [...]\n    } else if (g_strcmp0(interface, \"tizen_policy\") == 0) {\n        self-&gt;tizen_policy = wl_registry_bind(registry, id, &amp;tizen_policy_interface, 1);\n    } else if (g_strcmp0(interface, \"tizen_video\") == 0) {\n        self-&gt;tizen_video = wl_registry_bind(registry, id, &amp;tizen_video_interface, version);\n        g_return_if_fail(self-&gt;tizen_video != NULL);\n        tizen_video_add_listener(self-&gt;tizen_video, &amp;tizen_video_listener, self);\n    }\n    [...]\n}\n\n\nSpecific Video Formats (SN12, SN21, ST12, SR32, S420) for Zero copy\n\nThe SN12, SN21, ST12, SR32, and S320 formats are identical to NV12, NV21, NV12MT, BGRA, and I420, but the Multimedia framework uses these specific video formats to indicate that the formats are using a TBM buffer. Tizen provides a TBM buffer to avoid memory copying when transferring the buffer to different processes. Camerasrc or the video codec writes the video data to the TBM buffer, saves it to a pointer to GstBuffer, and sends it to Waylandsink. Waylandsink creates a wl_buffer with tbm_bo and requests rendering from the Window Server. There is no memory copy from Camerasrc or the video codec to the Window Server. This process is called Zero Copy.\n\nMMVideoBuffer\n\nThe Gst Element must use the MMVideoBuffer type when transferring TBM buffer. tbm bo must be stored in bo of MMVideoBufferHandle, and the type must be MM_VIDEO_BUFFER_TYPE_TBM_BO. Waylandsink makes wl_buffer by using the MMVideoBuffer information. If the video frame is not rendered, Waylandsink must make sure that the information in MMVideoBuffer in GstBuffer received from Camerasrc or Video Codec is correct.\n\ntypedef struct {\n    MMVideoBufferType type; /* Buffer type - the handle field that type indicates must be filled, and other handle fields are optional */\n    MMPixelFormatType format; /* Buffer type */\n    int plane_num; /* Number of planes */\n    int width[MM_VIDEO_BUFFER_PLANE_MAX] /* Width of buffer */\n    int height[MM_VIDEO_BUFFER_PLANE_MAX]; /* Height of buffer */\n    int stride_width[MM_VIDEO_BUFFER_PLANE_MAX]; /* Stride width of buffer */\n    int stride_height[MM_VIDEO_BUFFER_PLANE_MAX]; /* Stride height of buffer */\n    int size[MM_VIDEO_BUFFER_PLANE_MAX]; /* Size of planes */\n    void *data[MM_VIDEO_BUFFER_PLANE_MAX]; /* Data pointer(user address) of planes */\n    int handle_num; /* Number of buffer handle */\n    int handle_size[MM_VIDEO_BUFFER_PLANE_MAX]; /* Size of handles */\n    MMVideoBufferHandle handle; /* Handle of buffer */\n    int is_secured; /* Secured buffer flag, such as TrustZone memory; user cannot access it */\n    int flush_request; /* Flush request flag - if this flag is TRUE, sink element makes copy of last buffer, and it returns all buffers from src element. Then, src element can restart without changing pipeline state */\n    MMRectType crop; /* Crop information of buffer */\n} MMVideoBuffer;\n\nMMVideoBuffer can contain video data information of all cases, as shown in the following figure.\n\nFigure: MMVideoBuffer content\n\n\n\nTizen Viewport\n\nTo change the video frame render condition, the original open-source Waylandsink uses wlsurface_set_source(), wl_surface_set_buffer_transform(), wl_subsurface_set_position(), wl_viewport_set_destination(), and wl_surface_set_buffer_transform() functions. For more information on the Wayland API, see https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/. Waylandsink needs to IPC with wl_surface, wl_subsurface, and wl_viewport.\n\nFigure: Changing video frame render conditions\n\n\n\nFigure: Wayland protocols\n\n\n\nWaylandsink in the Muse Daemon requests rendering conditions on the wl_subsurface of the window created by the application. Therefore, it is difficult to match the geometry sync of the parent (Window) and wl_subsurface, due to the delay caused by the IPC communication between the Window Server and Wayland client. Since wl_viewport_ and wl_set_source_ are surface-based coordination, it is difficult to calculate the coordinates when the buffer is transformed. So Waylandsink for Tizen uses tizen_viewport supported Wayland Server for Tizen. To use tizen_viewport, Waylandsink binds tizen_policy_interface and tizen_video_interface. Now, Waylandsink only needs to IPC tizen_viewport.\n\nFigure: Tizen viewport\n\n\n\n\n  Example 1:\n\n  Example 2:\n\n  Example 3:\n\n  Example 4:\n\n\n\nFlush buffer\n\nSometimes, it is necessary to return GstBuffer while maintaining the video frame rendered in the window. In this case, use FlushBuffer, which is a wl_buffer created after copying TBM from GstBuffer coming from the video codec or Camerasrc. Waylandsink returns the GstBuffer to the video codec or Camerasrc immediately, and a request to render the FlushBuffer is made to the Window Server.\n\n\n  Gapless video playback\nWaylandsink receives the GST_EVENT_CUSTOM_DOWNSTREAM event from the player when it performs gapless video playback. The player creates a FlushBuffer.\n    #define GST_APP_EVENT_FLUSH_BUFFER_NAME \"application/flush-buffer\"\n\nstatic gboolean gst_wayland_sink_event(GstBaseSink * bsink, GstEvent * event) {\n    [...]  \n    switch (GST_EVENT_TYPE(event)) {\n    case GST_EVENT_CUSTOM_DOWNSTREAM:\n        s = gst_event_get_structure(event);\n        if (s == NULL || !gst_structure_has_name(s, GST_APP_EVENT_FLUSH_BUFFER_NAME))\n            break;\n        gst_wayland_sink_render_flush_buffer(bsink);\n    [...]\n}\n    \n  \n  keep-camera-preview\nThe camera sets this property when it needs to maintain the last video frame. Waylandsink copies the last TBM buffer and returns it immediately when the state changes (PAUSED_TO_READY).\n    keep-camera-preview : Last tbm buffer is copied and returned to camerasrc immediately when state change(PAUSED_TO_READY)\n                      flags: readable, writable\n                      Boolean. Default: false\n    \n  \n  flush_request of MMVideoBuffer\nCamerasrc and the video codec can set a flag to request a flushbuffer in the GstBuffer using MMVideoBuffer.flush_request = TRUE.\n\n\nAudio only mode\n\nWaylandsink has a disable-overlay property to support the player’s audio-only mode. If this property is set, the video frame is not rendered. When the player needs to show a video frame, it needs to set this property to false and set wl_surface_id.\n\ndisable-overlay : Stop using overlay by destroying wl_window and wl_display, Use gst_video_overlay_set_wl_window_wl_surface_id before setting FALSE to use overlay\n                              flags: readable, writable\n                              Boolean.

If this property is set to true, Waylandsink sends a handoff signal to the player.\n\nstatic GstFlowReturn gst_wayland_sink_render(GstBaseSink * bsink, GstBuffer * buffer) {\n    [...]\n    /* fakesink function for media stream callback case */\n    if (sink-&gt;signal_handoffs) {\n        GST_LOG(\"g_signal_emit: hand-off \");\n        g_signal_emit(sink, gst_waylandsink_signals[SIGNAL_HANDOFF], 0, buffer, bsink-&gt;sinkpad);\n        goto done;  /* Skip video rendering */\n    }\n    [...]\n}\n\n\nUse TBM\n\nWaylandsink use 2 types of buffers, shared memory and TBM memory. The default value of the use-tbm property is true and Waylandsink uses TBM memory. If the value is false, Waylandsink for Tizen uses shared memory just like the original open-source Waylandsink.\nuse-tbm  : Use Tizen Buffer Memory instead of Shared memory, Memory is allocated by TBM instead of SHM when enabled\n           flags: readable, writable\n           Boolean.

For the mobile profile, Tizen reused the proper UI components and created new ones, and then enhanced and adjusted all of them for Tizen native applications.\n\nThis feature is supported in mobile applications only.\n\nThe UI components are mobile-friendly: for example, the naviframe container component supports multiple view management, the entry component supports various modes (such as password, single-line or multi-line, edit or no-edit), the index component supports quick access to another group of UI items, and the toolbar component shows a menu when an item is selected.\n\nThe mobile UI components are designed to allow the user to interact with touch screen-equipped mobile devices. Therefore, when developing mobile applications, you can easily use them through the mobile-related infrastructure in company with view management, and when reacting to touch events and the user finger size.\n\nTable: Available UI components\n\n\n  \n    \n      Category\n      Component name\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Navigation elements\n      Toolbar\n      The  toolbar component is a scrollable list of items. It can also show a menu when  an item is selected. Only one item can be selected at a time.\n    \n    \n       \n      Index\n      The  index component provides an index for quick access to another group of UI  items.\n    \n    \n       \n      Segmentcontrol\n      The  segmentcontrol component is a horizontal control made of multiple segment  items, each segment item functioning similarly as a discrete 2-state button.\n    \n    \n      Presentation  views\n      Win\n      The  win component is the root window component often used in an application. It  allows you to create some content in it, and it is handled by the window  manager.\n    \n    \n       \n      Background\n      The  background component can be used to set a solid background decoration to a  window or a container object. It works like an image, but has some  background-specific properties, such as setting it to a tiled, centered,  scaled, or stretched mode.\n    \n    \n       \n      Genlist\n      The  genlist component displays a scrollable list of items. It can hold a lot of  items while still being fast and memory-efficient (since only the visible  items are allocated memory).\n    \n    \n       \n      Gengrid\n      The  gengrid component displays objects on a grid layout and renders only the  visible objects.\n    \n    \n       \n      Panel\n      The  panel component is an animated object that can contain child objects. It can  be expanded or collapsed by clicking the button on its edge.\n    \n    \n       \n      List\n      The  list component is a very simple list for managing a small number of items. If  you need to manage a lot of items, use the genlist component instead.\n    \n    \n       \n      Label\n      The  label component displays text with simple HTML-like markup.\n    \n    \n       \n      Image\n      The  image component can load and display an image from a file or memory.\n    \n    \n       \n      Icon\n      The  icon component inherits from the image component. It is used to display  images in an icon context.\n    \n    \n       \n      Progressbar\n      The  progressbar component can be used to display the progress status of a given  job.\n    \n    \n       \n      Photocam\n      The  photocam component is designed to display high-resolution photos taken with a  digital camera. It allows you to zoom photos, load photos quickly, and fit  photos. It is optimized for JPEG images and has a low memory footprint.\n    \n    \n      User  input\n      Button\n      The  button component is a simple push button. It is composed of a label icon and  an icon object, and has an auto-repeat feature.\n    \n    \n       \n      Check\n      The  check component toggles the Boolean value between true and false.\n    \n    \n       \n      Radio\n      The  radio component can display 1 or more options, while the user can only select  one of them. The UI component is composed of an indicator (selected or  unselected), an optional icon, and an optional label. Even though it is  usually grouped with 2 or more other radio components, it can also be used  alone.\n    \n    \n       \n      Entry\n      The  entry component is a box to which the user can enter text.\n    \n    \n       \n      Slider\n      The  slider component is a draggable bar that is used to select a value from a  range of values.\n    \n    \n       \n      Datetime\n      The  datetime component can display and accept input for date and time values.\n    \n    \n       \n      Colorselector\n      The  colorselector component provides a color selection solution to the user. It  has different modes, each of them showing a different configuration of the  color selection.\n    \n    \n       \n      Spinner\n      The  spinner component enables the user to increase or decrease a numeric value by  using arrow buttons.\n    \n    \n       \n      Flipselector\n      The  flipselector component shows a set of text items one at a time. The user can  flip the selector up or down to change the text on it.\n    \n    \n       \n      Calendar\n      The  calendar component displays and manipulates month views.\n    \n    \n      Assist  views\n      Popup\n      The  popup component shows a pop-up area that can contain a title area, a content  area, and an action area.\n    \n    \n       \n      Ctxpopup\n      The  ctxpopup component is a contextual popup that can show a list of items.\n    \n    \n       \n      Notify\n      The  notify component displays a container in a specific region of the parent  object. It can receive some content, and it can be automatically hidden after  a certain amount of time.\n    \n    \n       \n      Tooltip\n      The  tooltip component is a smart object used to show tips or information about a  parent object when the mouse hovers over the parent object.\n    \n    \n       \n      Hoversel\n      The  hoversel component is a button that pops up a list of items.\n    \n    \n      Transition\n      Transit\n      The  transit component can apply several transition effects to an Evas object,  such as translations and rotations.\n    \n    \n       \n      Flip\n      The  flip component can hold 2 Evas objects and let the user flip between these  objects using a variety of predefined animations.\n    \n    \n      Hardware  acceleration\n      GLView\n      The  GLView component can render OpenGL® in an Elementary object, hiding EvasGL  complexity.\n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      Map\n      The map component can  display a geographic map. The default map data is provided by the  OpenStreetMap project.\n    \n    \n       \n      Plug\n      The  plug component allows you to show an Evas object created by another process.

            "content": "Building UI Layouts\n\nA layout lays out the arrangement of different graphical elements of a user interface. Designing a layout is a fundamental part of building a user interface, unless you want to display only one UI component in your application throughout the running time. In most cases, applications have more than one view changing over time, and a view consists of many graphical elements.\n\nUI Containers\n\nEFL supports building layouts in the form of special Elementary UI components, classified as containers. Elementary provides a set of UI containers which enable displaying UI components in an organized layout. Each UI container has a different purpose and distinct behaviors, so it is important to select the most suitable one for your layout.\n\nContainer UI components do not have their own visual identity. They only have logical structures for assignment or placement of other UI components. The use of container UI components only differs from the use of the UI components due to the absence of a visual identity.\n\nTable: UI containers\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Box\n      Arrange more than 2 objects linearly.\n    \n    \n      Conformant\n      Resize and position the content area based on the space taken by, for example, an indicator, a virtual keyboard and a softkey window.\n    \n    \n      Grid\n      Place objects at specific positions along a fixed grid.\n    \n    \n      Layout\n      Take a standard Edje design file and wrap it very thinly in a UI component.\n    \n    \n      Mapbuf\n      Improve the moving and resizing performance of a complex UI component by treating it as a single Evas map image.\n    \n    \n      Naviframe\n      Manage many views by stacking them and displaying the topmost one.\n    \n    \n      Panes in mobile applications only\n      Resize 2 sections of content by adding a draggable bar between them.\n    \n    \n      Scroller\n      Hold and clip a single object and allow users to scroll across it.\n    \n    \n      Table\n      Arrange multiple objects like for a box, but with 2 dimensions.\n    \n  \n\n\nBasic EFL UI Layout\n\nThe basic UI layout structure of an EFL application is as follows: a window is filled with a conformant, and the conformant is filled with a naviframe.\n\nEach component has a specific role:\n\n\n  \n    A conformant accounts for the space taken up by a factor outside the application layout, such as rotation, an indicator, a virtual keyboard, and a softkey window. A conformant has to be present in every application.\n\n    The content is resized and positioned based on the space available.\n  \n  \n    A naviframe acts as a view manager and optionally provides the application title. Most of the time, your application has to manage multiple views, and the easiest way to handle them is to create a naviframe object. Every Tizen application can use this top-layer object to facilitate navigation.\n\n    The main layout of the application is added to the naviframe view area.\n  \n\n\nThe above structure is highly recommended and very usual, but it is not essential for every application. For example, if your application displays only one view statically throughout the running time, it does not need a naviframe.\n\nFigure: Basic EFL UI Layout\n\n\n\nstatic void\ncreate_base_gui(appdata_s *ad)\n{\n    /* Window */\n    /* Create and initialize elm_win,\n       which is mandatory to manipulate a window\n    */\n    ad-&gt;win = elm_win_util_standard_add(PACKAGE, PACKAGE);\n    elm_win_autodel_set(ad-&gt;win, EINA_TRUE);\n\n    if (elm_win_wm_rotation_supported_get(ad-&gt;win)) {\n        int rots[4] = {0, 90, 180, 270};\n        elm_win_wm_rotation_available_rotations_set(ad-&gt;win, (const int *)(&amp;rots), 4);\n    }\n\n    evas_object_smart_callback_add(ad-&gt;win, \"delete,request\", win_delete_request_cb, NULL);\n    eext_object_event_callback_add(ad-&gt;win, EEXT_CALLBACK_BACK, win_back_cb, ad);\n\n    /* Conformant */\n    /* Create and initialize elm_conformant,\n       which is mandatory for the base UI to have a proper size\n       when an indicator or virtual keypad is visible\n    */\n    ad-&gt;conform = elm_conformant_add(ad-&gt;win);\n    elm_win_indicator_mode_set(ad-&gt;win, ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_HIDE);\n    evas_object_size_hint_weight_set(ad-&gt;conform, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND, EVAS_HINT_EXPAND);\n    elm_win_resize_object_add(ad-&gt;win, ad-&gt;conform);\n    evas_object_show(ad-&gt;conform);\n\n    /* Naviframe */\n    ad-&gt;nf = elm_naviframe_add(ad-&gt;conform);\n    evas_object_show(ad-&gt;nf);\n    elm_naviframe_prev_btn_auto_pushed_set(ad-&gt;nf, EINA_TRUE);\n    elm_object_content_set(ad-&gt;conform, ad-&gt;nf);\n\n    evas_object_show(ad-&gt;win);\n}\n\n\nSize Hints\n\nWhen you use a container component, such as a naviframe, a conformant, or a box, you need to understand certain APIs related to size hints.\n\nSize hints are a set of functions that can be used on any Evas object. You request Evas to take care of various properties, and Evas honors these requests if it can. This is why they are called “hints”. You can also use the respective get functions to get the current hint values. You can use more than 2 size hint functions together to make the layout you want.\n\n\n  \n    Alignment\n\n    To change the alignment of an object relative to its container, use the evas_object_size_hint_align_set() function. It takes 2 double values, a horizontal and vertical value, representing the percentage between 0.0 and 1.0 of the alignment in the horizontal and vertical axes. By default, the object is centered with a value of 0.5.\n\n    EVAS_HINT_FILL or -1.0 can be given as a horizontal and vertical value, meaning that you request Evas to fill the Evas object in the parent area.\n  \n  \n    Weight\n\n    To set a weight size hint, use the evas_object_size_hint_weight_set() function. The weight size hint represents the Evas objects weight comparing to that of other Evas objects in the container.\n\n    By default, the weight is not set, and the size of the object is its minimum size. But if you set this value to 1.0, the object expands as much as it can inside the container.\n  \n  \n    Minimum and maximum size\n\n    To set the minimum size of an object, use the evas_object_size_hint_min_set() function. Evas respects the minimum size you define for the object. You can also set a maximum size of an object using the evas_object_size_hint_max_set() function.\n\n    When you resize the parent of an object, the minimum size of the parent is the minimum hint size of the object, if there are no constraints to the parent. If you increase the parent size, the object grows larger until its maximum hint size is reached. After this point, the object does not grow any larger and there is empty space around it within the parent.\n  \n  \n    Aspect\n\n    To fix the dimensional proportions of the object, use the evas_object_size_hint_aspect_set() function. When the aspect size hint is set, Evas tries to fix the dimensional proportions of the object.\n  \n\n\nFor examples on the use of the alignment, weight, and minimum and maximum size properties, see Box.\n\nRelated Information\n\n  Dependencies\n    \n      Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile\n      Tizen 2.3.1 and Higher for Wearable\n    \n  \n\n",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nThis topic provides some background information on what EFL is and how it works. To start programming right away, see Getting Started with EFL UI Programming.\n\nEFL is a collection of libraries that are independent or can build on top of each-other. They provide useful features that complement an OS’s existing environment, rather than wrap and abstract it, trying to be their own environment and OS in its entirety. This means that EFL expects you to use other system libraries and APIs in conjunction with EFL libraries to provide a whole working application or library - simply using EFL as a set of convenient pre-made libraries to accomplish a whole host of complex or painful tasks for you.\n\nAn important aspect of EFL is efficiency, both in speed and size:\n\n\n  The core EFL libraries, even with Elementary, are about half the size of the equivalent “small stack” of GTK+ (used, for example, by GNOME), and about one quarter the size of Qt. Of course, with these kinds of numbers, you can always argue over what exactly constitutes an equivalent measurement.\n  EFL is low on actual memory usage at runtime, with memory footprints a fraction the size of those in the GTK+ and Qt environments.\n  EFL is fast, considering what it does. Some libraries claim to be very fast - but then, it is easy to be fast when you only handle simple and straightforward tasks. EFL is fast, while also tackling the more complex rendering problems involving, for example, alpha blending, interpolated scaling, and transforms with dithering.\n\n\nThe Tizen platform provides EFL as one of the native UI toolkit frameworks for developing a native application.\n\nEFL Characteristics\n\nEFL is aimed at not only desktop computers but also touch-screen and embedded devices, making EFL applications portable to many different types of devices. Applications do not need to care about the types of devices and profiles they run on. Instead of changing the code, it is typically enough to simply configure the applications for different devices.\n\nThe key characteristics of EFL include:\n\n\n  \n    Fast performance\n\n    The main reason Tizen adopted EFL as its native toolkit is its speed. EFL is highly optimized by using a scene graph and retained-mode rendering. EFL is fast even in software rendering.\n  \n  \n    Small memory footprint\n\n    Despite its fast performance, EFL’s memory footprint is smaller than that of other toolkits with similar features. A small memory footprint is useful in the embedded world, since embedded devices do not normally have much memory.\n  \n  \n    Backend engine support\n\n    EFL supports several backend engines, such as X11 (OpenGL®, Xlib, Xcb), Wayland (OpenGL®, SHM), Direct Framebuffer, DRM, memory buffers, PS3 native, Windows®, and macOS. Applications do not need to deal with each backend engine separately.\n  \n  \n    GUI and logic separation\n\n    EFL supports a GUI layout (EDC) and logic separation by having the layout description in a plain text file and the logic code in the C or C++ source files.\n  \n  \n    Themeable\n\n    An EFL theme can be changed at runtime without restarting the application. UI components are customizable so that each application can create its own customized theme to overlay above the default theme, adding customized versions of UI components to achieve a specific look and feel.\n  \n  \n    Scalable\n\n    EFL supports a scale factor that affects the size of objects in the application at runtime. By configuring the scale factor, applications can scale up and down as needed. The scale factor also supports a default setting that allows applications to scale nicely out-of-the-box.\n  \n  \n    Animations\n\n    EFL supports different types of animations. Evas supports Evas maps with low-level APIs for performing 2D, 2.5D, and 3D object transformations. Edje supports predefined transitions and wrapping of Evas maps. Elementary supports transit APIs for various types of animations, which can be combined.\n  \n  \n    Hardware acceleration\n\n    EFL supports OpenGL® and OpenGL® ES acceleration.\n  \n\n\nLibraries in EFL\n\nEFL is a collection of libraries. They cover a range of functionality from managing the application life-cycle to rendering graphical objects. EFL libraries build on top of each other in layers, steadily becoming higher-level, yet allowing access to each level as they go. The higher up you go, the less you have to do yourself. The Elementary library is about as high up as you get, while you still access layers below it for day-to-day tasks, as there is no need to wrap tasks that work perfectly well as-is.\n\nFigure: EFL layers\n\n\n\nTable: Libraries in EFL\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Elementary\n      Elementary (UI Components) is the topmost library with which you create your EFL application. It provides all the functions you need to create a window, create simple and complex layouts, manage the life-cycle of a view, and add UI components. The full list of UI components that can be used in Tizen can be found in Mobile UI Components and Wearable UI Components.\n    \n    \n      Edje\n      Edje is the library used by Elementary to provide a powerful theme. You can also use Edje to create your own objects and use them in your application, or even extend the default theme. For more information on Edje and the EDC format, see Layouting with EDC and Customizing UI Components.\n    \n    \n      Ecore\n      Ecore (Core loop and OS Interfacing) is the library that manages the main loop of your application. The main loop is one of the most important concepts you need to know about to develop an application. The main loop is where events are handled, and where you interact with the user through the callback mechanism. The main loop mechanisms are explained in Handling the Main Loop.\n    \n    \n      Evas\n      Evas (Primitive Graphical Objects) is the canvas engine. Evas is responsible for managing the drawing of your content. All graphical objects that you create are Evas objects.\t\t Evas handles the entire state of the window by filling the canvas with objects and manipulating their states. In contrast to other canvas libraries, such as Cairo, OpenGL®, and XRender, Evas is not a drawing library but a scene graph library that retains the state of all objects. The Evas concept is explained in Evas Rendering Concept and Method.\t\t Evas objects are created and then manipulated until they are no longer needed, at which point they are deleted. This allows you to work in the same terms that a designer thinks in: it is a direct mapping, as opposed to having to convert the concepts into drawing commands in the right order, and calculate minimum drawing calls needed to get the job done.\n    \n    \n      Eina\n      Eina is the basis of all the EFL libraries. Eina is a toolbox that implements an API for data types in an efficient way. It contains all the functions needed to create lists and hashes, manage shared strings, open shared libraries, and manage errors and memory pools. Eina concepts are explained in Data Types and Tools.\n    \n  \n\n\nIn addition to the most important libraries explained above, the EFL includes other libraries, such as Eet, Embryo, and Emotion. Support for those libraries is planned in the future Tizen releases.\n\nHow EFL Works\n\nEFL brings a few new or different paradigms to the table. Some of these mesh well with what is already done, while others are vastly different, but bring major benefits if understood and used correctly. One of the major paradigms is the rendering and canvas model that EFL has, thanks mostly to Evas, Ecore, and Edje. In order to understand it, you must first understand the general event and work flow model. Everything slots in nicely if this model is embraced (and extended appropriately).\n\nEFL has embraced the same main loop concept that GTK+ and many other toolkits and software have adopted. It has rolled it wholeheartedly into the system as the core. The idea is that you do some initialization of the application and then enter a main loop function (in Ecore it is the ecore_mainloop_begin() function, or if you use Elementary, it wraps this with a shorter elm_run() function):\n\n\n  This loop function sits in a loop and checks for events, handles timers and other services, and calls callbacks set up beforehand or during the running of the loop.\n  The loop function exits if it has been requested to exit (in Ecore using the ecore_main_loop_quit() function, and in Elementary that wraps Ecore using the elm_exit() function).\n\n\nFor those familiar with traditional game programming, this is familiar, except that you have also implemented the main loop with an infinite while or for loop that fetches input events, updates the game world, renders the updated scene, and then loops and repeats as quickly as it can.\n\nIn EFL, the main loop is not “dumb” and does not consume CPU resources unless there is work to do. It sleeps and consumes no CPU time until an event happens (except in rare circumstances, for example, when you use idlers that are called in a loop during what normally would be idle time waiting for something to happen). From EFL’s point of view, all of this is handled in Ecore, and it supports many constructs for manipulating the main loop in a logical and flexible way. EFL handles animation through animators, where the main loop handles timing out and scheduling these at regularly spaced intervals in time (on a best-effort basis), as with timers, pollers, idle enterers, idle exiters, idlers, jobs, fd handlers (file descriptor handlers) and event handlers.\n\nIn the EFL view, the application, when executing any callbacks other than idlers, is “active”. It goes in and out of this active state by calling the idle enterer and exiter callbacks (edge-triggered callbacks), which are triggered whenever going in and out of the idle state. Idlers themselves do not transition the main loop as such from being in an idle state, so any idler that needs to “wake up” the loop (to make the application conceptually active) needs to queue something that ordinarily wakes up the main loop, such as a job or timer. This is the only exception due to the conceptual model and the need for efficiency (not entering and exiting idle per idler call).\n\nBesides the above exception, the loop model basically starts by calling the idle enterers, and then sleeps until something happens. What happens depends on the system, but wake-up events can be time-based (timers and animators) and these are scheduled by Ecore on a “best effort” basis. That means they use the system sleep mechanism (such as select() function with a timeout or epoll() function) to send the CPU to sleep and wait until an event on an input (a file descriptor) wakes up, or until the timeout happens.\n\nThe system can impose granularity limits on a sleep, so beware that this is not a guaranteed action, but in general good enough. Once Ecore wakes up, it finds out why it woke up and handles the situation appropriately. It calls timers or animators that expired, or calls fd handlers to read data (or write data) on “ready” fds and queue events as a result of this. Ecore also does some things that other main loops do not, such as serializing UNIX system handlers into the main loop event queue, so that things like SIGCHLD from child processes is handled for you with an event for the child exit placed in your event queue.\n\nRendering and Canvas\n\nEvas and Edje live within the main loop model described above. Evas is the canvas engine that handles the entire “state” of a “window” (canvas) by filling that canvas with objects and manipulating their state. You can, for example, show, hide, move, and resize the objects, set the file sources for images, colors for rectangles, and fonts and text content for text.\n\nWhen Evas renders, it evaluates the state of all objects and whether they have changed since the last rendering, and works out what to render and how to reflect the updated state of the canvas in the output. Evas attempts to minimize this update work, since it knows the prior and current state of every object, as well as knowing the entire canvas content:\n\n\n  Evas can discard work well in advance as it knows that “later I cover up this rendering anyway”, and thus Evas can skip it.\n  Evas defers as much work until the render time as it can, as at this point it considers the canvas state as “stable” and needing an update. This means that Evas can load fonts and images from the disk at the time it renders, to avoid repeated “create object, set image file, delete the object, create new one” cycles that can happen often during setup or major state changes. By deferring work as late as possible, Evas can avoid lots of “busy work” in doing useless tasks.\n\n\nThe work minimization allows the application using Evas to worry less about such optimizing and more about its logic flow, as the above “skip the work” optimizations are often done for you.\n\nA major change caused by having such a canvas and state model for the GUI is that you no longer actually render anything yourself. You must change the mindset from a “I draw” to “I create and manipulate” model. This is very different from almost all lower and even mid-level APIs that developers are used to - everything from Xlib, Cairo, and GDI to OpenGL® and more. They all work on the “draw and forget” model, while Evas is a retained-mode scene graph that you manipulate.\n\nEvas makes the cost of most operations (such as evas_object_move(), evas_object_resize(), and evas_object_show()) be “zero cost” (or as close to zero as possible). All most of these calls do is to update coordinates within an object and set a changed flag. That is it. They do not draw anything. For example, even setting the file on an image object through the evas_object_image_file_set() function only loads the image header, so the object can have the original image dimensions and alpha channel flag set. It does not decode the image data, avoiding a lot of file IO and decode overhead, and pushes this off until later (render time, if the image is visible and the data needed). If you are sure that you need the data though, Evas has the ability to begin an asynchronous preload of the image data in a background thread and inform you when it is ready.\n\nIf you mold your programming paradigm around this scene graph and state engine, you find yourself spending less time fighting EFL, and in fact end up with very lean, compact, and concise code that is almost entirely program and UI logic, which is what your application should be anyway, with all the nasty footwork being done for you. If you want to work with a more traditional model, where you have to take care of rendering yourself and you literally drive the timeline by hand, you find yourself fighting EFL and spending a lot of code and time working against optimizations and streamlining. Work with the model and your applications begin to be clean and seamless expressions of high-level logic, with the low-level handled for you by EFL in a clean and efficient way.\n\nRelated Information\n\n  Dependencies\n    \n      Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile\n      Tizen 2.3.1 and Higher for Wearable\n    \n  \n\n",

The framework provides the window, UI components, and scene-based graphic rendering architecture needed to manage your application user interface. In addition, the framework provides animations and effects needed to make your application more fresh and vivid, event handling and the main loop to interact with the user and system, and other features, such as scalability and font setting. The Tizen platform provides the EFL and DALi UI toolkit frameworks.\n\nYou can use the following user interface features in your native applications:\n\n\n  \n    Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL)\n\n    You can use the EFL UI toolkit if you are creating a 2D-based Tizen native application. However, EFL supports 2.5D and 3D effects and 3D objects as well. EFL provides streamlined graphic core libraries you need to create powerful applications. EFL needs relatively low memory but provides high performance, and supports a retained mode graphics system and user-centric features, such as themes, 2D/3D effects, and accessibility. In addition, EFL supports various resolutions with the same layout, fast and small file systems, a variety of programming language bindings, and a separate UI and logic.\n  \n  \n    Dynamic Animation Library (DALi)\n\n    You can use the DALi 3D UI toolkit if you are creating a high-performance rich UI application. DALi is based on OpenGL® ES 2.0 and 3.0; however, it hides the complexity of the OpenGL® ES API from you. DALi requires a GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) on the device.\n\n    DALi is multithreaded to improve performance and scalability, and enables developers to quickly create Rich UI applications with realistic effects and animations such as:\n\n    \n      Image &amp; Video galleries\n      Music players\n      Games\n      Maps\n      Homescreens / launch pads\n      Advanced watch faces for wearable devices\n    \n  \n\n\nRelated Information\n\n  Dependencies\n    \n      Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile\n      Tizen 2.3.1 and Higher for Wearable\n    \n  \n\n",

You can create diverse applications with a variety of features, and design versatile applications and intriguing user interfaces with text and graphics while taking advantage of many device functionalities, such as sensors and call operations. In addition, you can, for example, manage content and media files, use network and social services, and provide messaging and embedded Web browsing functionality.\n\nThe Tizen platform also provides a special kind of native application model, which consists of 1 UI native application and 1 or more native service applications.\n\nThe native API specification consists of multiple API modules that represent the versatility and wide variety of features that you can implement in your native application. Each API module represents a set of logically similar submodule APIs which can be grouped into the same category. This structure was designed to make it easier for you to narrow down and find the specific methods that you require to implement a feature in your native application.\n\nThere are two types of submodules  - Tizen native modules and open source modules. The integration of open source modules in the native API structure allows you to add additional features by using well-known open source libraries. This is particularly advantageous for developers who are familiar with certain libraries because they can quickly add features and use previously written code in certain cases.\n\nThe following table defines the Tizen mobile native API layout. The table describes the API modules and the functionality of all their submodule APIs within that module.

            "title": "Overview",
            "content": "Tizen Native Application\n\nThe Tizen native application model handles application life-cycle and system events. Tizen native application life-cycle is handled by the Application API (in mobile\nand wearable\napplications). It provides functions to manage the main event loop, the application state change events, and basic system events.\n\nTizen supports both UI applications (which have a graphical user interface) and service applications (which have no graphical user\ninterface). The UI and service applications can be packaged together, if necessary; however, a combined application package must contain only 1 UI application, while it can have several service applications.\n\nApplications in the same package follow the same installation life-cycle, which is handled by the application package manager. Each\napplication in the package follows its own application life-cycle. Each application (UI application or service application) in an application package can be identified by its own ID.\n\nThe following figure shows the UI and service application life-cycle.\n\nFigure: UI and service application life-cycle\n\n\n\nA Tizen native application is similar to a conventional Linux application, with some additional features optimized for mobile and\nwearable devices. These devices have constraints, such as relatively small screen sizes and lack of system resources compared to a larger system.\n\nFor example, for power management reasons, well-designed applications reduce resource usage when they detect that their display window is covered by another application window. State change events make the detection possible.\n\n\nNative Application Life-cycle\n\nA Tizen native application can be in one of several different states.\nTypically, the application is launched by the user from the Launcher, or by another application. When the application is starting, the app_create_cb() function is executed and the main event loop starts.  The application normally at the top window, with focus.\n\nWhen the application loses the focus status, the app_pause_cb() callback is invoked. The application can go into the pause state, which means that your application is not terminated but continues to run in\nthe background, when:\n\n  A new application is launched by the request of your application.\n  The user requests to go to the home screen.\n  A system event (such as an incoming phone call) occurs and causes a resident application with a higher priority to become active and temporarily hide your application.\n  An alarm is triggered for another application, which becomes the\ntopmost window and hides your application.\n\n\nSince Tizen 2.4, an application in the background goes into a suspended state. In the suspended state, the application process is executed with limited CPU resources. In other words, the platform does not allow the running of the background applications, except for some exceptional applications (such as Media and Download) that necessarily work in the\nbackground. In this case, the application can designate their background category as an allowed category to avoid going into the suspended state.\n\nWhen your application becomes visible again, the app_resume_cb() callback is invoked. The visibility returns, when:\n\n\n  Another application requests your application to run (for example, the Task Navigator, which shows all running applications and lets user select any application to run).\n  All applications on top of your application in the window stack finish.\n  An alarm is triggered for your application, bringing it to the front and hiding other applications.\n\n\nWhen your application starts exiting, the app_terminate_cb() callback is invoked. Your application can start the termination process, when:\n\n  Your application itself requests to exit by calling the ui_app_exit() or service_app_exit() function to terminate the\nevent loop.\n  The low memory killer is terminating your application in a low\nmemory situation.\n\n\nBecause a service application has no UI, neither does it have a pause state. Since Tizen 2.4, a service application can go into the suspended state. Basically, the service application is running in the background by its nature; so the platform does not allow running the service application unless the application has a background category defined in its manifest file. However, when the UI application that is packaged with the service application is running on the foreground, the service application is also regarded as a foreground application and it can be run without a designated background category.\n\nApplication state changes are managed by the underlying framework. For more information on application state transitions, see Application States and Transitions.\n\n\nStarting the Tizen Native Application\n\nAn application can be launched by the user from the Launcher or by another application. Either way, the Application Framework starts the\napplication by creating a new process and calling the application entry point. Like in a conventional Linux application, the application main\nfunction is the entry point. For more information on launching native applications, see Application\nControls.\n\n\nPackage ID and Application ID\n\nWhen developing a Tizen application, you must define a package and application ID:\n\n\n  \n    Package ID\n\n    The package ID, such as org.tizen.message or org.tizen.call, is the application package identifier.\n\n    The package ID functions as a unit for package installation, uninstallation, and updates. It is also the unit of the application package DRM, sandboxing, and privilege.\n  \n  \n    Application ID\n\n    The application ID (appid) is the application identifier. Multiple applications are allowed in a package and the application ID is used to identify the different applications.\n\n    The application ID must be the same as the package ID if the package contains a single application. If the package contains multiple applications, the application ID must be assigned with the package ID as a prefix. For example, if the org.tizen.message package contains 2 applications, the main application is named as org.tizen.message, and the second application is named as org.tizen.message.app2.\n\n    The application ID functions as a unit for launching and terminating applications, and for App Control.\n  \n\n\nYou can use the a~z, A~Z, 0~9, “.”, “-“, and “_” characters for the package and application ID. Both values must be shorter than 50 characters.\n\nThe following figure shows how to use the package and application ID.\n\nFigure: Package ID and application ID\n\n\n\n\nApplication Directory Policy\n\nThe following list shows the directory hierarchy:\n\n\n  bin: Executable binary path\n  lib: Library path\n  res: Resource path\n  data: The application’s own directory (read or write); no initial data\n  \n    shared/: For sharing with other applications\n\n    Sandboxing refers to an application package which can access its own directories only. It is used to share resources in the shared directories.\n\n    In sandboxing, SMACK is used, and discretionary access control (DAC) is applied to application package directories and files. The uid(root, app) is applied to directories and files.\n  \n\n\nThe tizen-manifest.xml file and signature files are located in the application root directory.\n\nPermissions\n\nThe installed packages have a user ID, a group ID, permissions, and a smack label.\n\nFigure: Permissions\n\n\n\nThe following table shows the details of files and directories.\n\nTable: Package data\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      File or directory\n      Owner:Group\n      Permission\n      Smack label\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      bin\n      Directory\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {PackageId}1\n    \n    \n      data\n      Directory\n      app:app\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {PackageId}\n    \n    \n      lib\n      Directory\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {PackageId}\n    \n    \n      res\n      Directory\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {PackageId}\n    \n    \n      shared\n      Directory\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      -\n    \n    \n      shared/data\n      Directory\n      app:app\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {Random}2 transmute\n    \n    \n      shared/res\n      Directory\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      -\n    \n    \n      shared/trusted\n      Directory\n      app:app\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {Cert Hash}3 transmute\n    \n    \n      author-signature.xml\n      File\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {PackageId}\n    \n    \n      signature1.xml\n      File\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {PackageId}\n    \n    \n      signature2.xml\n      File\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {PackageId}\n    \n    \n      signatureN.xml\n      File\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {PackageId}\n    \n    \n      tizen-manifest.xml\n      File\n      root:root\n      rwxr-xr-x\n      {PackageId}\n    \n  \n\n\n1 The {PackageId} is the package ID, such as org.tizen.browser.\n\n2 {Random} means that there is a 28-byte random string created by the\nsmack module.\n\n3 {Cert Hash} refers to a 28-byte string where [Raw Hash] equals to\nBase64Encode (SHA1 author certificate in author-signature.xml) and\n{Cert Hash} replaces “/” with “#” in [Raw Hash].\n\n\nApplication Manifest\n\nThe following example shows the beginning of the Tizen manifest schema:\n\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" elementFormDefault=\"qualified\" targetNamespace=\"http://tizen.org/ns/packages\" xmlns:packages=\"http://tizen.org/ns/packages\"&gt;\n   &lt;xs:import namespace=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace\" schemaLocation=\"xml.xsd\"/&gt;\n      &lt;xs:element name=\"manifest\"&gt;\n         &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\n            &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\n               &lt;xs:choice maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"&gt;\n                  &lt;xs:element ref=\"packages:label\"/&gt;\n\n\nThe following example shows the syntax of the manifest reference.

            "content": "\nTizen Applications\n\nTizen is a user-interactive and service-oriented open source project that allows you to create feature-rich applications for multiple device categories.\n\nTizen is designed to be equally friendly to embedded systems developers and Web developers alike, and its flexible nature encourages its use on an array of devices, including TVs, smart phones, watches, tablets, in-vehicle infotainment systems, and smart appliances. Tizen provides a Native API that provides the benefits of building software for embedded systems in C; it also provides a Web API that allows you to create simple programs using only HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nTo get started with the development of your own Tizen applications:\n\n\n  \n    Create your first Tizen .NET application, and learn about the main features available for implementing your dream application.\n  \n  Create your first simple native application, and learn about the main features available for implementing your dream application.\n  Create your first simple Web application, and learn about the main features available for implementing your dream application.\n\n\nThe Visual Studio Tools for Tizen is a collection of tools for developing Tizen .NET application.\n\n\n Download Visual Studio Tools for Tizen\n\nYou can develop, build, debug, profile, and emulate Tizen Native and Web applications.\n\n\n Download Tizen Studio\n\n\nTizen Application Types\n\nThe Tizen platform supports three primary application types:\n\n\n  \n    Native application is developed using C and can access more advanced device-specific features, such as camera, GPS, and accelerometer in addition to more advanced system settings and functionality.\n\n    The native applications use the Native API, which provides all of the memory management and performance benefits that come with building applications for Linux in C. The Native API is extremely helpful, as it includes dozens of API modules that cover a large range of capabilities. It provides numerous interfaces to much of the hardware that is found in modern mobile and wearable devices, and does so in an environment that is tailored for limited resources.\n  \n  \n    Web application is essentially a Web site stored on your device and built using Web-native languages, such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The Web application uses the Tizen Web Framework to interact with the native subsystems.\n\n    The Web applications use the Web API, which is a standard Web application project structure with basic elements. The Web API is designed to allow you to easily build applications using Web-native languages.\n\n    A program built using the Web API is laid out much like a standard Web site. It has an index.html file that serves as the root, and separate directories for resources, such as JavaScript, CSS, images, and sound resources. This approach makes Web application development in Tizen extremely intuitive for developers with a background in Web development, and makes it easy to quickly write simple applications using high-level languages.\n  \n  \n    Tizen .NET application is a new way to develop applications for the Tizen operating system, running on 50 million Samsung devices, including TVs, wearables, mobile devices, and many other IoT devices around the world. The existing Tizen frameworks are either C-based with no advantages of a managed runtime, or HTML5-based with fewer features and lower performance than the C-based solution.\n\n    With Tizen .NET, you can use the C# programming language and the Common Language Infrastructure standards and benefit from a managed runtime for faster application development, and efficient, secure code execution.\n  \n\n\nThe following figure illustrates the Tizen architecture model supporting the 3 application types.\n\nFigure: Tizen architecture\n\n\n\nThe Tizen platform also allows you to develop a hybrid application package where native and Web applications are packaged together to make more powerful applications. The Tizen platform ensures that all Tizen applications have consistent look and feel, regardless of whether you use the native or Web framework to create them.\n\n\nTizen Profiles\n\nTizen is built to work on a wide variety of platforms with a focus on embedded devices. In order to accommodate the various types of devices, a set of profiles has been defined to make it easier to develop applications for specific purposes and device types. Since Tizen 3.0, there are 3 profile types you can choose from: mobile, wearable, and TV. The mobile profile is designed for smart phones, the wearable profile is designed for smart watches, and the TV profile is designed for smart TVs.\n\nBoth mobile and wearable profiles are supported in native and Web application types. The TV profile is supported in the Web application type only.\n\nFigure: Applications using the mobile profile\n\n\n\nFigure: Applications using the wearable profile\n\n\n\nFigure: Applications using the TV profile\n\n\n\nTo become familiar with some terms that you encounter throughout this site, see Glossary.\nTo see the trademark notice list, see Trademarks.\n\nSee the following links for more information:\n\n  Source code (GIT/Gerrit): https://review.tizen.org/gerrit\n  Tizen Build setup (OBS): https://build.tizen.org/\n  Tizen Bug Tracking system (Jira): https://bugs.tizen.org/\n  Download URL: http://download.tizen.org/\n\n\n",

The primary purposes of Tizen are to create an open software platform available for carriers, OEMs, and developers to make their innovative ideas a reality and to introduce a successful, real-world product that improves the mobile experience for users.\n\nIt is also important that is no central point of failure, where 1 industry player can restrict or control the innovations of any other. The result is a full, production-quality consumer product with source code open for customization and porting.\n\nThe intent of the porting guides is to provide information and instructions to boot Tizen on new hardware and create products based on the Tizen OS. The Tizen porting guides take you through the porting process by elaborating the Tizen architecture, the necessary tools, and the development environment setup, as well as creating a Tizen image and demonstrating the modifications needed across various functional areas.\n\nTizen Architecture\n\nThe following figure illustrates the Tizen architecture for smart phone and tablet devices.\n\nFigure: Tizen architecture\n\n\n\nFor more information on the Tizen framework layer, see the Tizen Application Types.\n\nCore Layer\n\nThe core layer consists of various subsystems:\n\n\n  Application framework\nThe Application framework provides application management, including launching other applications using the package name, URI, or MIME type. It also launches predefined services, such as the system dialer application. The Application framework also notifies applications of common events, such as low memory events, low battery, changes in screen orientation, and push notifications.\n  Base\nBase contains GNU/Linux-based essential system libraries that provide key features, such as database support, internationalization, and XML parsing.\n  Connectivity\nConnectivity consists of all network and connectivity related functionalities, such as 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HTTP, and NFC (Near Field Communication). Data network is based on ConnMan (Connection manager), which provides 3G and Wi-Fi based network connection management.\n  \n    Graphics and UI\nGraphics and UI consist of the system graphic and UI stacks, which include EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries), window management system (x11 for Tizen 2.x / Wayland for Tizen 3.0), input methods, and OpenGL® ES APIs.\n\n    EFL, the heart of the graphics component, is a suite of libraries. EFL is used to create rich graphics with ease, for all UI resolutions. The libraries build UIs in layers, allowing for 3D transformations and more. EFL includes the Evas canvas API library and the elementary widget library.\n\n    WebKit-based graphics are provided as well, capable of running within a full browser UI or a dedicated Web runtime environment (without a browser window), all based on Tizen’s own HTML5 canvas WebKitEFL implementation. Additionally, WebGL™ is supported and Web-based frameworks for UI, such as jQuery Mobile, are also offered, which help with porting existing jQuery code.\n  \n  Location\nLocation provides location-based services (LBS), including position information, geocoding, satellite information, and GPS status. It delivers location information from various positioning sources, such as GPS, WPS (Wi-Fi Positioning System), Cell ID, and sensors.\n  Messaging\nMessaging consists of Message and Email. The Message supports SMS, MMS, and cell broadcast messages. Email supports protocols, such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3.\n  Multimedia\nMultimedia is based on GStreamer. It provides support for media, including video, audio, imaging, and VoIP. It also provides media content management for managing media file metadata information.\n  PIM (Personal Information Management)\nPIM enables managing user data on the device, including managing calendar, contacts, tasks, and retrieving data about the device context (such as device position and cable status).\n  \n    Security\nSecurity is responsible for security deployment across the system. It consists of the platform security enablers, such as access control, certificate management, and secure application distribution.\n\n    For more information, see Security/Tizen 3.0 security porting guide and All 3.X security pages.\n  \n  System\nSystem consists of service (process), device, and resource management features, including:\n    \n      Interfaces for accessing devices, such as sensors, display, or vibrator\n      Power management, such as LCD display backlight dimming/off and application processor sleep\n      Monitoring devices and handling events, such as USB, MMC, charger, and earjack events\n      Resource management, such as CPU quota control and low memory management\n      Service management, such as watchdog management and capability control\n    \n  \n  Telephony\nTelephony consists of cellular functionalities communicating with the modem:\n    \n      Provides call services (single call and multiparty call).\n      Provides call-related and non-call-related supplementary services (call waiting, barring, and forwarding and USSD).\n      Supports GSM, UMTS, LTE, and CDMA network services.\n      Provides packet services and network status information.\n      Provides SMS-related services.\n      Provides SIM card functionalities (SIM phonebook, SIM EF files, SIM Application Toolkit support)\n    \n  \n  Web\nWeb provides a complete implementation of the Tizen Web API optimized for low-power devices. It includes WebKit, which is a layout engine designed to allow Web browsers to render Web pages. It also provides Web runtime for Web applications.\n\n",

            "content": "Programming Principles of EFL\n\nThis topic explains the programming principles of EFL. Due to its hierarchical structure, EFL has certain characteristics distinguished from other frameworks, to which you need to pay attention while programming.\n\nObject Type\n\nEvas library is in charge of rendering in EFL, and it renders graphics by displaying a unit called an Evas object. It defines the data structure of the object type and provides the Evas_Object handle. In short, all graphical objects in EFL have the same data type: Evas_Object.\n\nThe following code snippet shows the return type of several EFL APIs:\n\nEvas_Object* win;\nEvas_Object* btn;\nEvas_Object* rect;\nEvas_Object* img;\n\nwin = elm_win_util_standard_add(\"test\", \"test\");\nbtn = elm_button_add(parent);\nrect = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas);\nimg = evas_object_image_add(evas);\n\n\nIn the above example, the object created by each function has the Evas_Object* type:\n\n\n  The objects created by the Elementary APIs are of the Evas_Object* type, whether they are a window or a button. Remember that Elementary is a wrapper of EFL, including Evas for user convenience.\n  The objects created by Evas APIs are of the Evas_Object* type, whether they are a rectangle or an image.\n\n\nAlthough Evas treats its objects equally, they have types which define their specific behavior and individual API.\n\nObject Visibility\n\nAll graphical objects in EFL (which are of the Evas_Object type) are hidden by default. This avoids unwanted events, such as mouse in, move, and out events due to objects being created underneath the current pointer position. It is more efficient, as you can show the object after you have finished defining its state. To show an object, you need to call the evas_object_show() function explicitly.\n\nThe following code snippet shows the process of displaying an object:\n\n/* Create a checkbox, which is invisible by default */\ncheck = elm_check_add(parent);\n/* Define its state */\nelm_check_state_set(check, EINA_TRUE);\n/* Switch the checkbox into a visible state */\nevas_object_show(check);\n\n\nAPI Domain\n\nAn EFL function has its own range of effects and you can tell the range by its name:\n\n\n  \n    Evas treats its objects equally, so it offers a function set that applies to any Evas object, whichever type that may have. These functions manipulate generic Evas objects:\n\n    \n      evas_object_show()\n      evas_object_hide()\n      evas_object_del()\n      evas_object_geometry_get()\n    \n\n    For more information, see the General API (in mobile and wearable applications).\n  \n  \n    Some function usage is limited to a certain object type. The following functions can only be used for the objects generated by the  evas_object_image_add() function:\n\n    \n      evas_object_image_file_set()\n      evas_object_image_size_get()\n      evas_object_image_preload()\n    \n\n    For more information, see the Specific Object Functions API (in mobile and wearable applications).\n  \n  \n    When it comes to Elementary, the UI components are built in a hierarchical fashion. The idea is to factorize as much code as possible between UI components that behave in a similar manner to facilitate the creation of new UI components.\n\n    The Elementary UI components inherit a lot of their code from the container UI components and the layout component (a container component that takes a standard Edje design file and wraps it very thinly). You can use the container and layout functions on the Elementary UI components, as well as the Elementary object functions, such as:\n\n    \n      elm_object_part_content_set()\n      elm_object_part_content_get()\n      elm_object_part_content_unset()\n    \n\n    For more information, see the Scroller API (in mobile and wearable applications).\n  \n  A single UI component has its individual API as well. The following functions can only be used for the objects generated by elm_entry_add() function:\n    \n      elm_entry_file_set()\n      elm_entry_bounce_set()\n      elm_entry_utf8_to_markup()\n    \n\n    For more information, see the Elementary Widgets API (in mobile and wearable applications).\n  \n  The elm_scroller is a UI component and an implementation of a scrollable interface at the same time. The following functions can be used for all UI components which implement a scrollable interface, such as elm_entry and elm_genlist:\n    \n      elm_scroller_region_show()\n      elm_scroller_region_bring_in()\n      elm_scroller_gravity_set()\n    \n\n    For more information, see the Scroller API (in mobile and wearable applications).\n  \n\n\nRelated Information\n\n  Dependencies\n    \n      Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile\n      Tizen 2.3.1 and Higher for Wearable\n    \n  \n\n",

With both images loaded into RAM, the kernel\ninitialization begins. When the initialization is complete, the kernel passes\ncontrol to the init process, such as /sbin/init (PID#1).\n  \n  \n    In the case of the recovery ramdisk, /sbin/init is a symlink to\n/usr/libexec/initrd-recovery/init (a shell script that comes\nfrom the initrd-recovery package). The script mounts several kernel\nfilesystems and the inform partition (if it exists), and parses the\nkernel command line options (/proc/cmdline) to find the bootmode\nparameter. If the parameter is present, one of the /sbin/*-init scripts is\nstarted. If the boot mode is set to recovery,\n/usr/libexec/system-recovery/recovery-init is started.\n  \n  \n    The recovery-init script mounts the real root filesystem under\nthe /system directory, and other filesystems (such as /opt and\n/opt/usr) below the /system directory. The script starts a shell on the serial console and launches the\nsystem-recovery program.\n  \n  \n    The system-recovery program can work as either an interactive GUI or\na non-interactive dispatcher, executing 1 (non-interactive) or\nmore (interactive) actions. The actions are configured in the\n/usr/share/system-recovery/system-recovery.cfg file.\n  \n\n\nConfiguration File\n\nThe configuration file allows you to customize 2 aspects of\nthe system-recovery operation: GUI and actions. The following sections take a closer look\nat the actions.\n\nThe configuration file is parsed using libconfig. For a detailed description of the\ngrammar, see the libconfig documentation.\n\naction_handlers\n\naction_handlers is a dictionary, in which shell commands (action\nhandlers) are assigned names (actions). The names are used later in\nthe configuration to refer to commands. The dictionary can be edited\nand actions can be added or removed. The names must be unique.\n\naction_handlers = {\n    reboot = \"reboot -f\";\n    factory-reset = \"touch -f /opt/.factoryreset\";\n    safeboot = \"touch -f /opt/etc/.safeboot\";\n}\n\n\nmenus\n\nActions (names) are used in the menus dictionary, which\ncomprises all pages of the menu system presented by\nsystem-recovery. The main entry is the one the program displays\nat startup. The rest must be linked in a tree-like structure.\n\nEach menu entry consists of the following fields:\n\n\n  pos_x and pox_y: Position on a screen\n  style: Reference to the menu_styles dictionary\n  actions: Array of actions available in this menu\n  item_default: Action to highlight when opening the menu\n\n\nThe system-recovery program can handle an action in 2 ways: it can run an action handler\nor switch to another screen. There is a reserved screen name BACK, which\nmeans switching to the previous screen (for more information, see screen_back in the screens\ndictionary).\n\nmenus = {\n    main = {\n        pos_x = 0;\n        pos_y = 100;\n        style = \"common\";\n        actions = ({\n            label = \"Reboot system now\";\n            screen_switch_to = \"reboot\";\n        },{\n            label = \"Safe mode\";\n            screen_switch_to = \"safe\";\n        },{\n            label = \"Phone reinitialisation\";\n            screen_switch_to = \"factory\";\n        });\n    };\n    reboot = {\n        pos_x = 0;\n        pos_y = 480;\n        style = \"common\";\n        item_default = 1;\n        actions = ({\n            label = \"Yes\";\n            action_handler = \"reboot\";\n            exit_after_action = 0;\n        },{\n            label = \"No\";\n            screen_switch_to = \"BACK\";\n        });\n    };\n    safe = {\n        pos_x = 0;\n        pos_y = 480;\n        style = \"common\";\n        item_default = 1;\n        actions = ({\n            label = \"Yes\";\n            action_handler = \"safeboot\";\n            exit_after_action = 1;\n        },{\n            label = \"No\";\n            screen_switch_to = \"BACK\";\n        });\n    };\n    factory = {\n        pos_x = 0;\n        pos_y = 480;\n        style = \"common\";\n        item_default = 1;\n        actions = ({\n            label = \"Yes\";\n            screen_switch_to = \"factory-run\";\n            action_handler = \"factory-reset\";\n            exit_after_action = 1;\n        },{\n            label = \"No\";\n            screen_switch_to = \"BACK\";\n        });\n    };\n};\n\n\n\n  Note\n\n  The system-recovery.cfg.m4.in source file provides the confirm_action m4 macro to define a Yes/No style action array:\n  \n    Yes executes an action.\n    No switches to a previous screen.\n  \n\n  Use this macro when adding an action to the config file in the repository.\n\n  For example:\n  actions = confirm_action('safeboot', 1);\n  \n  Expands to:\n  actions = ({\n    label = \"Yes\";\n    action_handler = \"safeboot\";\n    exit_after_action = 1;\n},{\n    label = \"No\";\n    screen_switch_to = \"BACK\";\n});\n  \n\n  The first argument of the macro is an action, and the second is the value to assign to the exit_after_action element.\n\n\nscreens\n\nEach action can either execute an action handler (a shell command) or switch to a screen. The screens are configured in\ntheir dictionary as follows:\n\nscreens = {\n    main = {\n        style = \"common\";\n        menu = \"main\";\n        description = \"main\";\n        rulers = \"main\";\n        images = (\"background_default\", \"menu_title\");\n        screen_back = \"CURRENT\";\n    };\n    reboot = {\n        style = \"common\";\n        menu = \"reboot\";\n        description = \"reboot\"\n        rulers = \"confirm\";\n        images = (\"background_default\", \"menu_title\");\n        screen_back = \"main\";\n    };\n    safe = {\n        style = \"common\";\n        menu = \"safe\";\n        description = \"safe\";\n        rulers = \"confirm\";\n        images = (\"background_default\", \"menu_title\");\n        screen_back = \"main\";\n    };\n    factory = {\n        style = \"common\";\n        menu = \"factory\";\n        description = \"factory\";\n        rulers = \"confirm\";\n        images = (\"background_default\", \"menu_title\");\n        screen_back = \"main\";\n    };\n    factory-run = {\n        style = \"common\";\n        description = \"factory-run\";\n        rulers = \"confirm\";\n        images = (\"background_default\", \"menu_title\");\n        animations = (\"working\");\n        screen_back = \"main\";\n        allow_force_reboot = 1;\n    };\n};\n\n\nThe above entries contain 2 parameter groups:\n\n\n  The first group is responsible for the look of a screen:\n    \n      style: Element of the screen_styles dictionary\n      rulers: Element of the rulers dictionary\n      images: List of elements of the images dictionary\n      animations: Element of the animations dictionary\n    \n\n    These parameters are not described in detail in this document.\n  \n  The second group comprises parameters that describe logic:\n    \n      menu: Menu to display (an element of the menus dictionary)\n      description: Description text and screen title to display (an element of the descriptions dictionary)\n      screen_back: Screen to switch to when switching BACK\n      allow_force_reboot: Reboot after executing an action\n    \n  \n\n\ndescriptions\n\nThe elements of the descriptions dictionary hold screen titles and\nbrief descriptions for screen entries:\n\n\n  title: Short (one line) title displayed at the top of a screen\n  description: Brief explanation of actions available on the screen\n\n\ndescriptions = {\n    main = {\n        pos_x = 15;\n        pos_y = 480;\n        style = \"common\";\n        title = \"Controls:\";\n        text = \"Volume Up/Down to move menu cursor\\n\"\n            \"Power button to select\";\n    };\n\n    reboot = {\n        pos_x = 15;\n        pos_y = 100;\n        title = \"The phone will be restarted.\";\n        text = \"Continue?\";\n        style = \"common\";\n    };\n\n    safe = {\n        pos_x = 15;\n        pos_y = 100;\n        title = \"Safe mode:\",\n        text = \"The phone will be started in safe mode.\\n\"\n            \"Home screen will be changed to default\\n\"\n            \"setting and just allow a user to use\\n\"\n            \"only preloaded applications.\\n\"\n            \"Continue?\";\n        style = \"common\";\n    };\n\n    factory = {\n        pos_x = 15;\n        pos_y = 100;\n        title = \"Factory reset (except SD-card)\";\n        text = \"This will erase all data from your\\n\"\n            \"phone's internal storage, including\\n\"\n            \"settings of downloaded and preloaded\\n\"\n            \"applications and system configuration.\\n\"\n            \"Continue?\";\n        style = \"common\";\n    };\n\n    factory-run = {\n        pos_x = 15;\n        pos_y = 100;\n        style = \"common\";\n        title = \"Restoring settings to factory default.\";\n        text = \"Please wait.

The\neasiest way to make sure this happens is to list the package as a\ndependency in the initrd-recovery.spec file.\n\nThe mkinitrd-recovery.sh script copies or moves files from the\nrootfs partition to the initrd-recovery partition according to\ndirections provided in configuration files stored in the\n/usr/share/initrd-recovery/initrd.list.d directory. These files\nmust be packaged in the RPM packages together with the\nfiles to be put on the initrd-recovery partition. The configuration files are\ninterpreted as shell scripts and can be used to set the following\nvariables:\n\n\n  DIRECTORIES: Create directories.\n  DIR_SYMLINKS: Create symbolic links to directories.\n  LIBONLYS: Copy only the libraries required by the listed executable files.\n  MVWITHLIBS: Move the listed executable files and copy the required libraries.\n  SYMLINKS: Create symbolic links.\n  VERBATIMS: Copy the listed files. List non-executable files here.\n  WITHLIBS: Copy the listed executable files and the required libraries.\n\n\nThe SYMLINKS and DIR_SYMLINKS variables contain pairs of filenames separated with\ncolons.\n\nThe following section contains examples of the above variables:\n\nDIRECTORIES=\"\n/var/tmp\n/usr/lib/odbc\n\"\n\n# LinkFileName:Target\nDIR_SYMLINKS=\"\n/lib:usr/lib\n/opt:system/opt\n\"\n\nLIBONLYS=\"\n/bin/bash\n/bin/kill\n\"\n\nMVWITHLIBS=\"\n/usr/libexec/initrd-recovery/minireboot\n/usr/libexec/system-recovery/system-recovery.gui\n\"\n\nWITHLIBS=\"\n/usr/bin/sync\n/usr/bin/touch\n\"\n\nVERBATIMS=\"\n/usr/share/system-recovery/res/images/font.png\n/usr/share/system-recovery/res/images/menu-title.png\n/usr/share/system-recovery/system-recovery.cfg\n\"\n\n# LinkFileName:Target\nSYMLINKS=\"\n/sbin/recovery-init:/usr/libexec/system-recovery/recovery-init\n/usr/lib/bufmgr/libtbm_default.so:libtbm_sprd.so\n\"\n\n\nThe following real-world example comes from the initrd-recovery\npackage. Following this configuration, mkinitrd-recovery.sh copies\nsome basic tools to the initrd-recovery partition, moves init and\nminireboot, and creates some symlinks:\n\nMVWITHLIBS=\"\n/usr/libexec/initrd-recovery/init\n/usr/libexec/initrd-recovery/minireboot\n\"\n\nWITHLIBS=\"\n/usr/bin/bash\n/usr/bin/cat\n/usr/bin/mkdir\n/usr/bin/mount\n/usr/bin/sleep\n/usr/bin/sync\n/usr/bin/umount\n/usr/sbin/blkid\n\"\n\n# LinkFileName:Target\nSYMLINKS=\"\n/bin/sh:bash\n/sbin/init:/usr/libexec/initrd-recovery/init\n/sbin/minireboot:/usr/libexec/initrd-recovery/minireboot\n/sbin/reboot:/usr/libexec/initrd-recovery/minireboot\n\"\n\n",

            "content": "Long-term Tizen RT Goals\n\nThe following sections describe various long-term development goals of Tizen RT.\n\nIoT JavaScript Framework\n\nTizen RT provides an application framework based on JavaScript. JavaScript is strong especially in IoT devices, since it has enormous developer community support and a fast development cycle. The application framework is built on top of an ultra-light JavaScript engine (JerryScript) and an asynchronous I/O event processing library (libtuv), which enable fast application development and prototyping for individual IoT developers. The IoT JavaScript Framework (IoT.js) is expected to support ARTIK in the first quarter of 2017 and continue to open source activities to increase the popularity of IoT.js.\n\nFigure: IoT JavaScript framework\n\n\n\nTable: IoT.js features\n\n\n  \n    \n      IoT.js feature\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Ultra-light JavaScript engine\n      Small enough to fit in IoT devices.Supports ES5.\n    \n    \n      Ultra-light JavaScript runtime\n      Supports IoT application lifecycle and JavaScript APIs, and requires IoT Applications.Supports asynchronous I/O event processing.\n    \n    \n      Binding layer for IoT library (such as OCF library)\n      Provides a binding layer and enables native functionality with additional libraries.In the case of OCF, basic features based on TinyAra are initially supported.\n    \n  \n\n\nSoftware Updates\n\nFor home appliance products, Tizen RT supports the proprietary software update mechanism developed by Samsung. As Tizen RT becomes an open source project, non-Samsung devices running Tizen RT require the software update service as well. To support non-Samsung devices, Tizen RT plans to support OMA lightweight M2M (LWM2M)-based FOTA in 2017. ARTIK Cloud already supports LWM2M.\n\nFault Tolerance\n\nIoT platforms face a challenge in the large-scale device management of deployed IoT devices. System reliability has become a key success factor for IoT platforms. If a critical bug in device drivers or other system components occurs, the whole system inevitably crashes in the case of a traditional monolithic kernel. A clear solution is needed to overcome this challenge; however, typical Tizen RT target devices have only an MPU (memory protection unit). Without an MMU (memory management unit), protecting the system from faults is much more difficult. To provide MPU-based fault isolation, Tizen RT pursues 4 approaches:\n\n\n  Per-thread memory protection\n  Microkernel architecture\n  Self-healing\n  Live update\n\n\nAssuming the completion of all these features, Tizen RT can be safely protected from any kind of faults. For example, even though a network component encounters a critical error, this fault can be identified by memory protection and isolated by the microkernel architecture. The network component can be restarted by self-healing without any effect on the entire system. If that component is not self-healed eventually, it can be updated by live update through software updating.\n\nMemory Protection\n\nTizen RT supports not only flat build, but also memory-protected build. The former can help to reduce the memory usage at the expense of memory vulnerability. The latter can be achieved at the cost of about 20~30% increase of memory usage. Which mode is more suitable for low-end IoT devices depends on the trade-off analysis, considering software requirements and hardware limitations.\n\nUser/kernel space separation has already been achieved. The entire memory map is divided into user and kernel spaces. The kernel space is exclusively accessed by the kernel only. Any user tasks which illegally attempt to access this memory region raise an exception. In this mode, the kernel executes with privileged permissions while user threads execute with unprivileged, restricted permissions, as shown in the following figure. Per-thread memory protection is expected to be implemented in the first half of 2017.\n\nFigure: User and kernel separation\n\n\n\nThe user thread is executed in the unprivileged mode with restricted permissions. When multiple threads are running, the scheduler preempts the currently-running task and brings the new ready-to-run thread for execution. The stack/data region of thread A is protected from being written by thread B even after thread A is preempted by thread B. This per-thread protection can be realized by the MPU which stores and restores the MPU context of every thread at every context switch.\n\nMicrokernel Architecture\n\nThe microkernel aims at minimizing kernel functions by only including scheduling, task, memory, and IPC. Other kernel modules, such as device drivers, network stacks, and file system, must be isolated from the kernel as isolated components. This isolation means that each system component executes as a separate user space thread/task. The kernel can communicate with the isolated components in the user space through IPC, as shown in the following figure. The frequency of IPC usage inevitably becomes higher than that of a monolithic architecture. This is why the minimized overhead IPC design is a key success factor of the microkernel architecture. The microkernel architecture is to be designed in the first half of 2017 and the per-thread memory protection implementation is to be followed by microkernel implementation.\n\nFigure: Microkernel architecture\n\n\n\nSelf-healing\n\nRecovering from failures makes a system sustainable. To this end, Tizen RT can detect faults regardless of where they happen, as shown in the following figure.\n\nFigure: Self-healing\n\n\n\n\n  A dedicated service manager component monitors all system components through IPC and controls their execution.\n  When a crash event is detected, a notification is sent to the components (orange balloon) which have a dependency with the faulted component (pink crashed balloon).\n  The orange component immediately halts its dependent tasks and waits for messages from the service manager.\n  If the manager restarts the corrupted component and judges that the restarted component is operating normally, it informs the orange component that the corrupted component has been successfully restarted.\n  The orange component resumes the halted tasks and communicates normally with the restarted component through IPC.\n\n\nThe implementation of self-healing takes place after that of the microkernel architecture.\n\nConfigurability\n\nBuild configuration allows you to select the Tizen RT features you need at compilation time. Tizen RT can be configured from a full-featured platform to a small, connectivity-oriented platform.\n\nThe following table illustrates 3 full-featured configuration examples. Typical hardware requirements for wearable band and low-end home appliance configurations include Cortex-M4/R4, more than 256 KB RAM, more than 1 MB flash memory, and Wi-Fi or NB-IoT/Cat-M connectivity. For a connectivity-oriented platform, such as a sensor device, the typical hardware requirements for the configuration include Cortex-M3, less than 256 KB RAM, less than 1 MB flash memory, and IEEE 802.15.4 or BLE connectivity. This build-time configuration is based on Kconfig, which is the same as in Linux. For GUI configuration, Tizen RT uses menuconfig, which is also the same as in Linux.\n\nTable: Example Tizen RT configurations\n\n\n\nSupport for Standard IoT Protocols\n\nWhile keeping support for the latest IoTivity version, Tizen RT supports other standardized IoT protocols, such as Thread and IPSP over BLE in 2017. These protocols can promote IoTivity across heterogeneous connectivity devices.\n\nSupport for Low-end Wearable Bands\n\nThe PoC of a lightweight UI framework was developed in 2016 and is evolving into a commercial-level verified framework. This helps IoT manufacturers make their own low-end wearable bands with small LCDs.\n",

            "content": "Tizen RT 1.0 Specification\n\nIoT Data Management\nTizen RT manages data in the following ways:\n\n  File system support\nTizen RT supports not only the SmartFS lightweight file system, but also a virtual file system (VFS). The VFS can provide a common interface set in the form of the POSIX API. Standard libc APIs are already supported. In addition, some advanced features are also included:\n    \n      Proc File System for debugging, and ROM File System for read-only data\n      SmartFS for a flash file system with wear-leveling, bad sector management, and transaction-logging-based journaling\n      MTD (Memory Technology Device) and MTD Partition\n    \n  \n  Database (AraStorage) support\nAraStorage, a lightweight database, can manipulate collected sensor data with SQL-compatible interfaces. AraStorage also provides some advanced features, such as:\n    \n      b+ tree-based indexing algorithm\n      Cursor structure to improve usability for the application layer\n    \n  \n\n\nDevice Management\n\nTizen RT incorporates the OMA-based Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol for device management. LWM2M is an application layer communication protocol between an LWM2M server and an LWM2M client that typically resides on a resource-constrained device. The LWM2M protocol can be briefly described in the context of its interface and stack design:\n\n\n  LWM2M interfaces\n    \n      Bootstrap: The LWM2M client obtains information about the LWM2M server from the LWM2M bootstrap server. The LWM2M bootstrap server holds the credentials of all registered LWM2M servers, and can provide the details either on request (client-initiated bootstrap), or explicitly (server-initiated bootstrap). At present, client-initiated bootstrap is already developed and verified. Server-initiated bootstrapping is planned to be included.\n      Registration: Once the LWM2M client has the necessary information about an LWM2M server, it opens a connection to the server and registers itself as an LWM2M device. Registration, in this context, also includes providing details of the LWM2M objects that the client has created during initialization.\n      Device management and service enablement: The LWM2M server uses this interface for query (read and discover), modify (write), and execute operations, as well as for creating and deleting attributes on a registered LWM2M client object. While basic read operations are currently verified, support for other operations is to be provided later.\n      Information reporting: The LWM2M server uses this interface to periodically query the registered LWM2M client to send updates on an object attribute (such as a sensor value or communication signal strength). Alternatively, the LWM2M server can also direct the LWM2M client to notify it about changes in attribute values over a programmable time interval. The LWM2M protocol allows the LWM2M server to specify the observation time interval, and the range of permissible attribute values, beyond which a notification must be sent.\n    \n  \n  LWM2M protocol stack\n    \n      CoAP protocol: The LWM2M entities (client, server, and bootstrap server) use the CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) for implementing the 4 LWM2M interfaces described above. CoAP offers the advantage of an efficient payload structure, which is necessary for resource-constrained client devices. In this context, LWM2M-based request and response messages are mapped on to appropriate CoAP methods (such as GET, PUT, and POST), as described in RFC 7252.\n      DTLS security: While LWM2M optionally functions in a ‘NoSec’ (no security) mode, it also allows the use of DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) to ensure authentication, data confidentiality, and integrity between an LWM2M client and an LWM2M server or bootstrap server. The LWM2M client has the option of bootstrapping with a pre-shared secret, or with public certificates (either raw public keys or X.509v3). In all cases, the LWM2M client must possess a unique key for securing communication with the LWM2M bootstrap server and the LWM2M server. These features are planned to be supported on Tizen RT.\n      UDP: LWM2M allows the use of both UDP and SMS protocols for communication between a client and server. The lightweight M2M component in Tizen RT uses UDP binding over port 5683. Reliability over UDP is achieved using the CoAP retransmission mechanism.\n    \n  \n\n\nIP Network\n\nFor the TCP, UDP, and IPv4 protocols, LWIP is already ported on Tizen RT and successfully verified. As for IPv6, the uIP-based stack is already implemented and was granted the “IPv6 Ready Logo” by the IPv6 Forum. To increase maintainability, a common base for the network stack is needed. Both IPv4 and IPv6 based on the common project (such as LWIP or uIP) are to be released.\n\nTransition between IPv4 and IPv6 is also required. Suppose that sensor devices are equipped with only IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 or IPSP/BLE. These devices need to connect to the Internet directly or through hubs or other IoT devices. Tizen RT is preparing to fit into these relaying IoT devices by implementing transition functions between IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nIoTivity\n\nTizen RT 1.0 currently supports IoTivity 1.1.0. The next release updates IoTivity support to version 1.2.\n\nIoTivity 1.2 Base Layer Support (OCF 1.0 Base Layer Ready)\n\nTizen RT supports the IoTivity base layer for constrained-device communication in the IoT world. It supports IoTivity 1.2 release as base code with the OCF 1.0 spec ready.\n\nIP transport (TCP/UDP over Wi-Fi) is currently supported in the Connectivity Abstraction (CA) layer.\n\nThe following figure shows the IoTivity base layer architecture. The architecture can be divided into discovery, messaging, and security modules.\n\nFigure: IoTivity base layer architecture\n\n\n\nThe following table describes the IoTivity 1.2 features in Tizen RT.\n\nTable: Iotivity features\n\n\n  \n    \n      Module (base layer)\n      Feature\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Discovery\n      Multicast Discovery, Device Presence\n      Discovers resources, and checks for device presence.\n    \n    \n       \n      Resource Introspection\n      Manages resource types and properties.\n    \n    \n      Messaging\n      CoAP Messaging\n      Transmits messages between devices.\n    \n    \n       \n      Message switching\n      Not supported by Tizen RT.\n    \n    \n       \n      Connectivity Abstraction\n      Currently Supports Wi-Fi transport. Support is planned for more protocols, such as BT, BLE, and NFC.\n    \n    \n       \n      Block-wise transfer\n      Provides block data transfer (more than 1 KB data).\n    \n    \n       \n      CoAP over TCP\n      Provides reliable transmission. It can be used for messaging between a device and cloud.\n    \n    \n      Security\n      DTLS\n      Provides a secure channel with data encryption for UDP.\n    \n    \n       \n      Security Resource Manager\n      Provides an access control mechanism.\n    \n    \n       \n      Security Provisioning Manager\n      Transmits credentials for authentication.\n    \n  \n\n\nIoTivity 1.2 Feature Support\n\nTizen RT supports:\n\n\n  IoTivity 1.2.0 base layer stack (csdk layer) with Wi-Fi transport\n  Resource creation and publishing for resource discovery (resource registration, discovery, update, and delete)\n  Device-to-device communication with UDP over a secured DTLS channel\n  Wi-Fi transport over IPv4 (supported in Tizen 4.0)\n  CoAP over TCP for communicating with the IoT cloud (resource registration, discovery, update, and delete)\n  TLS for TCP to enable security for cloud communication\n  Presence for the server side and presence callback for the client side\n  Onboarding (Wi-Fi provisioning) for new devices to enable easy setup onto the network\n  Cloud provisioning to connect a device to the cloud and to publish a resource to it\n  Keep-alive mechanism to keep the cloud session active with CoAP over TCP\n  Direct pairing support for credential delivery to transfer device ownership for easy setup\n  Multiple ownership transfer and multiple ownership structure in the Security Resource Model\n  Message-oriented communication interface for the cloud. This interface can be used for a publish/subscribe-based information exchange. A resource model for a CoAP-based message broker is to be provided.\n\n\nIoTBus Framework\n\nThe IoTBus Framework supports system I/O APIs, including the following 5 API categories:\n\n\n  GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)\nProvides functions to control generic pins. They can be configured for input or output, because GPIO pins have no predefined purpose.\n  I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit)\nProvides functions to read values of I2C devices or write commands to I2C devices. These APIs are typically used to connect sensor devices or for intra-board communications.\n  SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)\nProvides functions to communicate with SPI devices. These APIs support synchronous serial communication interfaces used for short-distance communication. Full duplex modes using a master-slave architecture with a single master are also served.\n  PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)\nProvides functions to get and set duty cycles and periods of PWM devices. These APIs are typically used to control servo motors or LEDs.\n  UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)\nProvides functions to read and write for asynchronous serial communication. These APIs are usually used in conjunction with communication standards, such as RS-232, RS-422, and RS-485.\n\n\nDevice Management Framework\n\nThe following features are to be made available under the Device Management Framework:\n\n\n  Configuration\nThe LWM2M client is configured with a set of parameters that include the LWM2M bootstrap server address, bootstrap server port, and LWM2M session lifetime. Alternatively, if a direct connection to the LWM2M server is preferred, the client can be configured with the LWM2M server address and port information.\n  Temporary Halt and Resumption\nWireless links, especially in indoor deployments, are prone to intermittent failures, and can momentarily halt an ongoing LWM2M session. Taking this into account, the Device Management Framework must gracefully close all LWM2M sessions with their respective servers, and also logically resume the sessions once the wireless link is restored.\n  Support for Multiple Servers\nThe LWM2M specification allows multiple servers to perform device management with a registered LWM2M client. To this end, the framework must facilitate the seamless addition of LWM2M server information.\n  Device Management Services\nServices provided under Device Management can be broadly categorized into 4 types:\n    \n      Connectivity monitoring, which relates to connectivity details, such as client IP address, network type, signal strength, and effective data rate.\n      Power monitoring, which relates to the available power states of a device, its current power state, and the time spent in different power states.\n      Error reporting, which relates to out-of-memory conditions, and also temporary wireless connection losses.\n      Software update, which relates to querying a firmware repository for updates, version checking, downloading, and installing firmware packages.\n    \n\n    Tizen RT 1.0 supports the first 3 service types. Software update is to be included in the next version.\n  \n\n",

            "title": "Setting up the Development Environment",
            "content": "# Setting up the Development Environment\n\nThis topic provides information on how to set up a development environment.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> If you encounter problems while obtaining the repo tool, see [Development Tips](tips.md).\n\n## Setting Up Gerrit Access\n\nYou can set up access to [Tizen Gerrit](http://review.tizen.org/gerrit/) through the following steps:\n\n1. Register a user account to gain access to tizen.org.\n2. Configure Secure Shell (SSH) for Gerrit access.\n3. Configure Git for Gerrit access.\n\n### Registering a User Account\n\nTo register a user account to gain access to tizen.org:\n\n1. Open the [Register page](https://www.tizen.org/user/register).\n2. Fill in the mandatory fields and other necessary information, and click **Register**.  \n   Gerrit sends a verification email to the email address you have provided.\n3. Follow the instructions in the verification email to verify the email address, change the password, and gain access to tizen.org.\n   > **Note**\n   >\n   >  If an error message is shown when you click the link in the verification email, copy the link to the address bar of the browser manually.\n\nAt this point, the prerequisites for accessing Gerrit are ready. Move on to the next section to enable Gerrit access.\n\n### Configuring SSH for Gerrit Access\n\nTo configure SSH for Gerrit access:\n\n1. Generate RSA keys:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ ssh-keygen [-t rsa] [-C \"\"]\n   ```\n\n   > **Note**\n   >\n   > `[-t rsa]` and `[-C \"\"]` are both optional arguments for the `ssh-keygen` command.\n   >\n   > If invoked without specifying key type, `ssh-keygen` generates an RSA key for use in SSH protocol 2 connections, thus making `[-t rsa]`, which specifies the key type, optional.\n   >\n   > For an RSA key, if invoked without adding any comment, `ssh-keygen` initializes the comment as \"@\" when the key is generated, thus making `[-C \"\"]` optional. In spite of this, adding this argument is recommended because a rephrased comment can make it easier to identify the keys.\n\n   Based on the on-screen prompts, specify the file in which to save the key, and the passphrase.\n\n   ```\n   Enter file in which to save the key (/home//.ssh/id_rsa):\n   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\n   Enter same passphrase again:\n   ```\n\n   If you press ENTER directly for the file, the default value `/home//.ssh/id_rsa` is used. If you press ENTER directly for the passphrase, no passphrase is used.\n\n   At this point, the SSH keys are successfully generated.\n\n2. Create an SSH configuration file, `~/.ssh/config`, and add 1 of the following, as appropriate:\n\n   - Ubuntu, openSUSE, CentOS, or Debian:\n\n     ```\n     Host tizen review.tizen.org\n     Hostname review.tizen.org\n     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n     User \n     Port 29418\n     # Add the line below when using proxy, otherwise, skip it\n     # ProxyCommand nc -X5 -x : %h %p\n     ```\n\n   - Fedora:\n\n     ```\n     Host tizen review.tizen.org\n     Hostname review.tizen.org\n     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsaUser \n     Port 29418\n     # Add the line below when using proxy, otherwise, skip it\n     # ProxyCommand nc --proxy-type socks4 --proxy : %h %p\n     ```\n\n   > **Note**\n   >\n   > - Both \"tizen\" and \"review.tizen.org\" are aliases of the hostname. \"tizen\" is configured for simplicity of commands when initializing Git repositories and cloning specific Tizen projects, and \"review.tizen.org\" is configured to work with the `manifest.xml` and `_remote.xml` files when synchronizing the entire Tizen source.\n   >\n   > - The `~/.ssh/config` file must not be written in by other users. Make sure to remove the write permission by executing `chmod o-w ~/.ssh/config`. For more information on `ssh_config`, see `man ssh_config`.\n\n3. Copy the full text in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, including all of the following:\n\n   - `ssh-rsa` lead\n   - SSH public key\n   - Email address tail\n\n4. Log in to [Tizen Gerrit](http://review.tizen.org/gerrit/) and upload the key:\n\n   1. In the Gerrit Web page, click the user name on the top right corner (with an inverted triangle on the right), and select **Settings**.\n   2. Click **SSH Public Keys** in the left panel, paste the text copied earlier into the **Add SSH Public Key** box, and click **Add**.\n\n5. Verify the SSH connection:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ ssh tizen\n   ```\n\n   The following message indicates that SSH connection has been established successfully:\n\n   ```bash\n   **** Welcome to Gerrit Code Review ****\n   ```\n\n### Configuring Git for Gerrit Access\n\nGit must know the user's name and email address to determine the author of each commit. If the user name or email address is not set up in a way that Git can find it, the user can encounter some odd warnings.\n\nThis configuration operation requires developer access. In addition, it is recommended to match the email address with the one registered in contact information, which helps Git identify the user.\n\nTo configure Git for Gerrit access:\n\n1. Set the user name by executing the following command:\n   ```bash\n   $ git config --global user.name \n   ```\n2. Set the email address by executing the following command:\n   ```bash\n   $ git config --global user.email \"\"\n   ```\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> Using the `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` environment variables is an alternative solution. These variables override all configuration settings once set.\n\n## Setting Up the GBS Configuration\n\nYou can set up the GBS configuration through editing the `.gbs.conf` file.\n\n### Setting Up the Default GBS Configuration File\n\nThe default GBS configuration file is located in `~/.gbs.conf`:\n\n```\n[general]\nprofile =

Tizen version 4.0 and Tizen version 5.0. In the near future in new GBS versions, the above default configuration file (`~/.gbs.conf`) is automatically installed when GBS is installed.\n\nThe default profile used in GBS is specified in the `[general]` section:\n\n```\n[general]\nprofile = profile.unified_standard\n```\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> The default GBS build parameters, based on the above block, are as follows:  \n> - Tizen version: 5.0  \n> - Profile: unified  \n> - Repository: standard\n\n### Setting Up a Specific Profile in the `.gbs.conf` File\n\nTo build using a non-default Tizen version, profile, or repository, select 1 of the profiles specified in the `.gbs.conf` file and set that profile in the `[general]` section, using the following format:\n\n```\n[general]\nprofile = profile.\"$Version\"\"$Profile\"_\"$Repository\"\n```\n\n- If the Tizen version is 3.0, `$Version` equals \"3.0-\".\n- If the Tizen version is 4.0, `$Version` equals \"4.0-\".\n- If the Tizen version is 5.0, `$Version` equals \"\".\n\nOther examples:\n\n- Tizen 5.0 Unified / emulator repository\n\n  ```\n  [general]\n  profile = profile.unified_emulator\n  ```\n\n- Tizen 4.0 Unified / emulator repository\n\n  ```\n  [general]\n  profile = profile.4.0-unified_emulator\n  ```\n\n- Tizen 3.0 Common / arm64-wayland repository\n  ```\n  [general]\n  profile = profile.3.0-common_arm64-wayland\n  ```\n\n- Tizen 3.0 Common / emulator32-wayland repository\n  ```\n  [general]\n  profile = profile.3.0-common_emulator32-wayland\n  ```\n\n- Tizen 3.0 Mobile / target-TM1 repository\n  ```\n  [general]\n  profile = profile.3.0-mobile_target-TM1\n  ```\n\n- Tizen 3.0 TV / arm-wayland repository\n  ```\n  [general]\n  profile = profile.3.0-tv_arm-wayland\n  ```\n\n- Tizen 3.0 Wearable / target-circle repository\n  ```\n  [general]\n  profile = profile.3.0-wearable_target-circle\n  ```\n\n- Tizen 3.0 IVI / emulator repository\n  ```\n  [general]\n  profile = profile.3.0-ivi_emulator\n  ```\n\nEach `profile` entry in the `.gbs.conf` file specifies multiple `repo` entries, and each `repo` entry specifies a URL where RPM files used in the GBS build are located.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> The `latest` directory in the remote repository URLs is a symbolic link in the remote server, which is always linked to the latest new directory and can be changed any time, so make sure to use the latest repo with a specific date to guarantee usability. An example is shown below:\n> ```\n> url = http://download.tizen.org/releases/daily/tizen/unified/latest/repos/standard/packages/\n> ```\n> This URL is symbolically linked to the latest snapshot number in \"[http://download.tizen.org/releases/daily/tizen/unified/](http://download.tizen.org/releases/daily/tizen/unified/)\". To guarantee usability, use a specific date:\n> ```\n> url = http://download.tizen.org/releases/daily/tizen/unified/tizen-unified_20170627.1/repos/standard/packages/\n> ```\n\nFor more information on `.gbs.conf`, see [GBS Configuration](../reference/gbs/gbs.conf.md).\n\n## Setting Up the Repo Tool\n\nRepo is a repository management tool built on top of Git.  Multiple Git repositories can be downloaded with a single repo command.\n\nTo install and set up the repo tool:\n\n1. Create a `~/bin/` subdirectory, include it in `PATH`, and switch to it:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ mkdir ~/bin/\n   $ PATH=~/bin:$PATH\n   ```\n\n2. Download the repo script:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo\n   ```\n\n   > **Note**\n   >\n   > If you encounter problems while obtaining the repo tool, see [Development Tips](tips.md).\n\n3. Change the attributes of the repo script to make it executable:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ sudo chmod a+x ~/bin/repo\n   ```\n\n## Working through a Network Proxy\n\nYou can set up your development environment to work through a network proxy.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> A network proxy is particularly useful if you also track other Git repositories for which you do not already have a dedicated `ProxyCommand` in your `~/.ssh/config`, or which use \"git://\" or \"http://\".\n\n### Configuring a Proxy\n\nTo configure a proxy through the Linux shell prompt:\n\n1. Open the `.bashrc` file and set the `http_proxy`, `ftp_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` environment variables:\n   ```\n    export http_proxy=:\n    export ftp_proxy=$http_proxy\n    export https_proxy=:\n    export no_proxy=\n   ```\n\n2. Open `/etc/sudoers` and preserve the environment variables by adding the following content:\n\n    ```\n    Defaults env_keep=\"http_proxy ftp_proxy https_proxy no_proxy\"\n    ```\n\n   > **Note**\n   >\n   > Replace \"=\" with \"+=\" if other `env_keep` settings already exist in `/etc/sudoers`.\n\n\n### Configuring Git Access through the Proxy\n\nTo allow Git access through the proxy:\n\n1. Create a script named `git-proxy` in the `/usr/local/bin` directory by using a text editor.\n\n   The following example uses VIM:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ sudo vim /usr/local/bin/git-proxy\n   ```\n\n2. Add the following lines into the file and save it:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n\n   PROXY=\n   PORT=\n\n   case $1 in\n   # list Git servers here that you do not want to use\n   # the proxy with, separated by a pipe character '|' as below:\n\n   review.tizen.org)\n   METHOD=\"-X connect\"\n   ;;\n   *)\n   METHOD=\"-X 5 -x ${PROXY}:${PORT}\"\n   #The line above is applicable to Ubuntu and openSUSE\n   #For Fedora, use the variation below since it only supports socks v4\n   #METHOD=\"-X 4 -x ${PROXY}:${PORT}\"\n   ;;\n   esac\n\n   nc $METHOD $*\n   ```\n\n3. Change the attributes of the `git-proxy` script to make it executable:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-proxy\n   ```\n\n4. Set the `GIT_PROXY_COMMAND` and `GIT_PROXY_IGNORE` environment variables by adding the following lines into the `.bashrc` file:\n\n   ```\n   export GIT_PROXY_COMMAND=/usr/local/bin/git-proxy\n   export GIT_PROXY_IGNORE=\n   ```\n\n5. Apply the changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n",

            "content": "# System\n\nYou can implement various features relatesd to the System framework and the file system.\n\n## Partition and File System\n\nThe following description is an example of the Tizen partition layout. Product vendors can modify the sequence or partition layout for their devices, as needed.\n\n1. The `boot` partition includes the kernel image, boot-loader image, and modem image. It can also contain device driver modules.\n1. The `rootfs` partition is mounted on the root directory. It contains the fundamental frameworks for Tizen and some general utilities for Linux.\n1. The `system-data` partition is mounted on the `/opt` directory. It contains the platform database and platform configurations.\n1. The `user` partition can be mounted on the `/opt/usr` directory separately. It contains user-installed applications.\n1. External storages are mounted on `/opt/media`.\n1. The partition image files (`rootfs.img`, `system-data.img`, and `user.img`) can be zipped for downloading, such as `.tar.gz`.\n\nThe `/etc/fstab` directory must be modified or the `systemd` mount units must be added based on the partition layout. Consequently, the `fstab` file or system mount unit files for specific devices must be added to the `system-plugin` Git repository. The following example shows an `fstab` file:\n\n```\n/dev/root         /               ext4    defaults,noatime 0      1\nLABEL=system-data /opt            ext4    defaults,noatime 0      2\nLABEL=user        /opt/usr        ext4    defaults,noatime 0      3\n```\n\n### Supported File Systems\n\nTizen supports the Extended 4 (Ext 4) file system as the default file system.\n\nTo enable support for other file systems, such as JFS, XFS, BTRFS, and Reiserfs, the Tizen kernel must be modified and compiled. The following configuration options must be enabled in the kernel configuration file:\n\n- `CONFIG_EXT4_FS=y`\n- `CONFIG_EXT4_FS_XATTR=y`\n- `CONFIG_EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT23=y`\n- `CONFIG_EXT4_FS_SECURITY=y`\n\n### File System Hierarchy\n\nThe Tizen directory hierarchy intends to follow the File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS) as much as possible, for compatibility with the Linux world. However, Tizen uses the `/opt` directory for Tizen-specific purposes: place all RW data in the `/opt` directory.\n\n**Figure: File system hierarchy**\n\n![File system hierarchy](media/467px-fsh.png)\n\nDirectory macros for accessing the Tizen-specific directories are provided in the Tizen platform configuration metafile. The following table lists some example macros.\n\n**Table: Example directory macros**\n| Directory macro | Real path    |\n| ---------------- | ------------ |\n| `TZ_SYS_DATA`    | `/opt/data`  |\n| `TZ_SYS_SHARE`   | `/opt/share` |\n| `TZ_SYS_VAR`     | `/opt/var`   |\n\n## System Framework\n\nThe System framework module abstracts low-level system functions and manages the Tizen system:\n\n- `systemd` requirements for system and service management\n    - Linux Kernel >= 3.4 , Linux Kernel >= 3.8 for Smack support\n    - `CONFIG_CGROUPS`, `CONFIG_TIMERFD`, `CONFIG_SIGNALFD`, `CONFIG_EPOLL`, ...\n- Basic resource requirements (such as CPU, memory) usage management\n  - Linux Kernel >= 3.10 for `VMPRESSURE`, Linux Kernel >= 3.8 for `MEMCG SWAP`\n  - `CONFIG_CGROUPS`, `CONFIG_CGROUP_SCHED`, `CONFIG_MEMCG`, `CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP`, ...\n- `deviced` requirements for device and power management\n    - Device HAL layer porting\n- dlog requirements  \nSelect a backend for the target environment and enable the appropriate kernel feature:\n    - Additional KMSG patch for multiple Kmsg backend\n    - Android&trade; logger driver for Android log backend\n    - Userspace logger daemon\n\nUsing the Linux kernel 3.10 or above is recommended.\n\n**Figure: System framework**\n\n![System framework](media/800px-systemfw.png)\n\n### systemd\n\n`systemd` (ver.219) is a system and service manager for the Tizen system. It provides functionalities, such as parallelized service execution, socket and dbus activation for starting services and daemons, on-demand daemon start-up, service process management using Linux `cgroup`, automount point support, and service snapshot and restore.\n\nThe `systemd` core manages all units, such as service, socket, and mount. It stores all log data. When you add a new service daemon, you need to provide the proper system units and unit dependencies.\n\nTo use `systemd`, you must enable the `cgroup` and `autofs` options in the [Linux](https://wiki.tizen.org/Linux) kernel configuration. It also depends on dbus and some libraries.\n\n### resourced\n\n`resourced` is a daemon that manages system resources, such as memory and CPU.\n\nTo use most of the `resourced` functionalities, you must enable the following `cgroup` kernel features:\n\n  - `CONFIG_CGROUPS`: Base feature\n  - `CONFIG_CGROUP_SCHED`: Controls the CPU share of applications\n  - `CONFIG_MEMCG`: Selects the victim in low-memory situations\n  - `CONFIG_FREEZER`: Freezes background (and idle) applications\n  - `CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP`, `CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED`, `CONFIG_ZRAM`, `CONFIG_ZSMALLOC`: Saves memory through compression\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> To use the `resourced` freezer feature, you must install the freezer plugin by enabling `CONFIG_FREEZER`.\n\n### deviced\n\n`deviced` is a daemon that handles device events, such as the battery level and plug-and-play device status, and provides interfaces to manage devices, such as power, display, and external storages. If your BSP does not provide the Linux kernel-standard interface, these functionalities can require a HAL layer:\n\n- Managing the LCD backlight state (on/off/dim)\n- Managing the CPU sleep state and handling requests to lock the CPU from sleeping\n- Monitoring external devices, such as USB cable, earjack, and charger\n- Monitoring the battery level\n- Managing external storages, such as SD card and USB storages\n- Controlling the vibrator\n- Setting the USB configuration for connecting to a host computer\n- Powering off the LED, IR, and other features\n- Using the device HAL to handle devices and get events\n\n### dlog\n\nTizen provides 3 logging system backends:\n\n- Multiple `kmsg` backend  \n  Requires a kernel patch. For more information, see https://lwn.net/Articles/677047/.\n- Android-logger backend  \n  Utilizes the Android logger driver.\n- User logger backend  \n  No requirement (you do not have to enable anything from dlog)\n\n### Porting the Smart Development Bridge (SDB)\n\nSDB is a device management tool used for remote shell command, file transfer, controlling device log out, and USB debugging.\n\n- To use SDB, you must install a kernel driver.  \n    For example:  \n    - [Gadget Driver for SLP based on Android](https://review.tizen.org/git/?p=profile/mobile/platform/kernel/linux-3.10-sc7730.git;a=blob;f=drivers/usb/gadget/slp.c;h=c0d935f5362cc5ae03807d3533fe84df88e8c354;hb=refs/heads/accepted/tizen_mobile)\n    - [Gadget Driver for Samsung SDB (based on Android ADB)](https://review.tizen.org/git/?p=profile/mobile/platform/kernel/linux-3.10-sc7730.git;a=blob;f=drivers/usb/gadget/f_sdb.c;h=7f334ba01139d6bcbe7668bd84582e078d563638;hb=refs/heads/accepted/tizen_mobile)\n- To recognize the target as a Tizen device, the SDB interface on the target device must have the following information in the USB interface descriptor:\n    ```\n    Class: 0xff\n    SubClass: 0x20\n    Protocol: 0x02\n    ```\n- When using multi-configuration, SDB must be located in the first configuration on the target multi-configuration system. The SDB client of the host PC (Linux PC) selects the first configuration.\n- To recognize the USB cable connection, you must port the External Connector Class (`extcon`) to the kernel. If `extcon` cannot be ported, you can enable SDB using the following shell command:\n    ```bash\n    /usr/bin/direct_set_debug.sh --sdb-set\n    ```\n\n### Porting the Device HAL Interface\n\nThe device HAL is applied for the hardware-independent platform. The device HAL consists of libraries corresponding to hardware, such as display, external connector, battery, LED, and IR. The HAL is used by `deviced` (device daemon) to control hardware, and manages the events of device state changes. `deviced` opens the implemented libraries and uses the APIs to control the devices.\n\nOEM developers must implement the API defined in the header files of the `libdevice-node` package and compile their libraries (`.so` file) for their devices.\n\nThe following code snippet shows the device HAL structure:\n\n```cpp\n#define MAKE_TAG_CONSTANT(A,B,C,D) (((A) = 0 && val > 0) {\n        *src = POWER_SOURCE_AC;\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    ret = sys_get_int(BATTERY_ROOT_PATH\"/\"POWER_SOURCE_USB\"/online\", &val);\n    if (ret >= 0 && val > 0) {\n        *src = POWER_SOURCE_USB;\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    ret = sys_get_int(BATTERY_ROOT_PATH\"/\"POWER_SOURCE_WIRELESS\"/online\", &val);\n    if (ret >= 0 && val > 0) {\n        *src = POWER_SOURCE_WIRELESS;\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    *src = POWER_SOURCE_NONE;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nstatic int\nbattery_get_current_state(BatteryUpdated updated_cb, void *data) {\n    int fd;\n    struct battery_info info;\n    char status[32];\n    char health[32];\n    char *power_source;\n\n    if (!updated_cb)\n        return -EINVAL;\n\n    info.name = BATTERY_HARDWARE_DEVICE_ID;\n\n\n    fd = open(BATTERY_ROOT_PATH\"/battery/status\", O_RDONLY);\n    read(fd, status, sizeof(status));\n    close(fd);\n    info.status = status;\n\n    fd = open(BATTERY_ROOT_PATH\"/battery/health\", O_RDONLY);\n    read(fd, health, sizeof(health));\n    close(fd);\n    info.health = health;\n\n    ....\n\n    get_power_source(&power_source);\n    info.power_source = power_source;\n\n    updated_cb(&info, data);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nstatic int\nbattery_open(struct hw_info *info, const char *id, struct hw_common **common) {\n    struct battery_device *battery_dev;\n    battery_dev = calloc(1, sizeof(struct battery_device));\n\n    battery_dev->common.info = info;\n    battery_dev->register_changed_event = battery_register_changed_event;\n    battery_dev->unregister_changed_event = battery_unregister_changed_event;\n    battery_dev->get_current_state = battery_get_current_state;\n\n    *common = (struct hw_common *)battery_dev;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nstatic int\nbattery_close(struct hw_common *common) {\n    free(common);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nHARDWARE_MODULE_STRUCTURE = {\n    .magic = HARDWARE_INFO_TAG,\n    .hal_version = HARDWARE_INFO_VERSION,\n    .device_version = BATTERY_HARDWARE_DEVICE_VERSION,\n    .id = BATTERY_HARDWARE_DEVICE_ID,\n    .name = \"battery\",\n    .open = battery_open,\n    .close = battery_close,\n};\n```\n\n#### Display HAL\n\nThe display HAL provides functions for controlling the display brightness. The HAL interface is defined in the `hw/display.h` header file of the `libdevice-node` library, and the `pkg-config` `device-node` must be used to use the HAL interface.\n\nThe following code snippet shows the display HAL interface:\n\n```cpp\n/*\n   Device ID\n*/\n#define DISPLAY_HARDWARE_DEVICE_ID \"display\"\n\n/*\n   Device version\n*/\n#define DISPLAY_HARDWARE_DEVICE_VERSION MAKE_VERSION(0,2)\n\nstruct display_device {\n    struct hw_common common;\n\n    /* Control display brightness */\n    int (*get_max_brightness)(int *brightness);\n    int (*get_brightness)(int *brightness);\n    int (*set_brightness)(int brightness);\n};\n```\n\nThe following table lists the display HAL functions.\n\n**Table: Display HAL functions**\n\n| Function prototype                       | Description                              | Mandatory |\n| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |\n| `int (*get_max_brightness)(int *brightness)` | Returns the maximum brightness value the display driver supports. | Yes |\n| `int (*get_brightness)(int *brightness)` | Returns the current brightness value. | Yes |\n| `int (*set_brightness)(int brightness)`  | Sets the brightness value.  | Yes |\n\nThe following code snippet shows an example of the display HAL:\n\n```cpp\n#ifndef BACKLIGHT_PATH\n#define BACKLIGHT_PATH \"/sys/class/backlight/panel\"\n#endif\n\nstatic int\ndisplay_get_max_brightness(int *val) {\n    static int max = -1;\n    char buf[BUF_MAX];\n    int fd;\n    if (max  max)\n        brightness = max;\n    snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"%d\", brightness);\n    fd = open(BACKLIGHT_PATH\"/brightness\", O_WRONLY);\n    write(fd, buf, strlen(buf));\n    close(fd);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nstatic int\ndisplay_open(struct hw_info *info,\n        const char *id, struct hw_common **common) {\n    struct display_device *display_dev;\n\n    if (!info || !common)\n        return -EINVAL;\n\n    display_dev = calloc(1, sizeof(struct display_device));\n    if (!display_dev)\n        return -ENOMEM;\n\n    display_dev->common.info = info;\n    display_dev->get_max_brightness = display_get_max_brightness;\n    display_dev->get_brightness = display_get_brightness;\n    display_dev->set_brightness = display_set_brightness;\n\n    *common = (struct hw_common *)display_dev;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nstatic int\ndisplay_close(struct hw_common *common) {\n    if (!common)\n        return -EINVAL;\n\n    free(common);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nHARDWARE_MODULE_STRUCTURE = {\n    .magic = HARDWARE_INFO_TAG,\n    .hal_version = HARDWARE_INFO_VERSION,\n    .device_version = DISPLAY_HARDWARE_DEVICE_VERSION,\n    .id = DISPLAY_HARDWARE_DEVICE_ID,\n    .name = \"Display\",\n    .open = display_open,\n    .close = display_close,\n};\n```\n\n#### External Connector HAL\n\nThe external connector HAL provides functions for getting the external connector device status. The HAL interface is defined in the `hw/external_connection.h` header file of the `libdevice-node` library, and the `pkg-config` `device-node` needs to be used to use the HAL interface.\n\nThe following code snippet shows the interface of the external connector HAL:\n\n```cpp\n/*\n   Device ID\n*/\n#define EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_HARDWARE_DEVICE_ID \"external_connection\"\n\n#define EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_USB \"USB\"\n#define EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_USB_HOST \"USB-HOST\"\n#define EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_TA \"TA\"\n#define EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_HDMI \"HDMI\"\n#define EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_DOCK \"Dock\"\n#define EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_MIC \"Microphone\"\n#define EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_HEADPHONE \"Headphone\"\n\n/*\n   Device version\n*/\n#define EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_HARDWARE_DEVICE_VERSION MAKE_VERSION(0,1)\n\nstruct connection_info {\n    char *name;\n    char *state;\n    int flags;\n};\n\ntypedef void (*ConnectionUpdated)(struct connection_info *info, void *data);\n\nstruct external_connection_device {\n    struct hw_common common;\n\n    /* Register external_connection event */\n    int (*register_changed_event)(ConnectionUpdated updated_cb, void *data);\n    void (*unregister_changed_event)(ConnectionUpdated updated_cb);\n\n    /* Get current states */\n    int (*get_current_state)(ConnectionUpdated updated_cb, void *data);\n};\n```\n\nThe following table lists the external connector HAL functions.\n\n**Table: External connector HAL functions**\n\n| Function prototype                       | Description                              | Mandatory |\n| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |\n| `int (*register_changed_event)(ConnectionUpdated updated_cb, void *data);` | Adds a callback function which is called when the external connector status changes. | Yes |\n| `void (*unregister_changed_event)(ConnectionUpdated updated_cb);` | Removes the callback function added for the external connector status event. | Yes |\n| `int (*get_current_state)(ConnectionUpdated updated_cb, void *data);` | Calls the function specified in the first parameter.

Most modern mobile operating systems have a framework which manages hardware and virtual sensors on the platform and provides convenient APIs to the application.\n\nSensors can be classified into hardware and virtual sensors. Tizen supports individual HALs for the following sensors:\n\n- Hardware sensors\n  - Accelerometer\n  - Geomagnetic sensor\n  - Gyroscope\n  - Light sensor\n  - Proximity sensor\n  - Pressure sensor\n  - Ultraviolet sensor\n  - Temperature sensor\n  - Humidity sensor\n  - HRM (Heart Rate Monitor)\n  - HRM LED green sensor\n  - HRM LED IR sensor\n  - HRM LED red sensor\n  - Uncalibrated geomagnetic sensor\n  - Uncalibrated gyroscope sensor\n  - Human pedometer\n  - Human sleep monitor\n  - Human sleep detector\n  - Human stress monitor\n- Virtual sensors\n  - Orientation sensor\n  - Gravity sensor\n  - Linear acceleration sensor\n  - Rotation vector sensor\n  - Gyroscope rotation vector sensor\n  - Geomagnetic rotation vector sensor\n\nThe sensor framework provides a sensor server for managing sensor HALs and a medium through which client applications are connected to the sensor handler to exchange data.\n\n**Figure: Sensor framework architecture**\n\n![Sensor framework architecture](media/678px-tizen-3-sensorfw.png)\n\nThe sensor HALs retrieve data from sensor hardware and enable client applications to use the data for specific requirements.\n\nThe Sensor framework consists of the following components:\n\n- Sensor client library  \nAny application that wants to access the sensor server and communicate with it must use the sensor API library. Using the Sensor API, the application can control sensors and receive sensor events from the sensor server. By using the sensor API, any application or middleware framework can have the sensor client library executing within its own process context.\n- Sensor server  \nThe sensor server is a daemon which communicates uniquely to multiple sensors (through drivers) in the system and dispatches sensor data or events back to the application. The sensor server is responsible for initializing the sensors during boot, driver configuration, sensor data fetching and delivery, and managing all sensors and clients on the platform.\n- Sensor HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)  \nThe sensor HAL, which is interfaced to the sensor server, is responsible for interacting with the sensor drivers. The HAL processes data from the sensor drivers and communicates it to the server. Hardware sensors must support the HAL. The sensor HAL is implemented as a shared library. The `sensor_loader` finds the `hal.so` library in the `/usr/lib/sensor/` directory, and loads it at boot time.\n\n### Porting the HAL Interface\n\nYou can port individual sensors or a sensorhub.\n\n#### Sensor\n\nTo port new hardware sensors, the HAL library-inherited `sensor_device` interface must be implemented. The HAL header files can be found at `git:sensord/src/hal`.\n\nThe Tizen HAL sensor types are also defined in the `sensor_hal_types.h` header file under the names `SENSOR_DEVICE_...`.\n\n**Figure: Sensor HAL**\n\n![Sensor HAL](media/tizen-3-sensor-fw-hal.png)\n\nThe following code snippet shows the interface of the sensor HAL in the `sensor_hal.h` header file:\n\n```cpp\n/*\n   Create devices\n*/\ntypedef void *sensor_device_t;\ntypedef int (*create_t)(sensor_device_t **devices);\n\n/*\n   Sensor device interface\n   1 device must be abstracted from 1 device event node\n*/\nclass sensor_device {\npublic:\n    virtual ~sensor_device() {}\n\n    uint32_t get_hal_version(void) {\n        return SENSOR_HAL_VERSION(1, 0);\n    }\n\n    virtual int get_poll_fd(void) = 0;\n    virtual int get_sensors(const sensor_info_t **sensors) = 0;\n\n    virtual bool enable(uint32_t id) = 0;\n    virtual bool disable(uint32_t id) = 0;\n\n    virtual int read_fd(uint32_t **ids) = 0;\n    virtual int get_data(uint32_t id, sensor_data_t **data, int *length) = 0;\n\n    virtual bool set_interval(uint32_t id, unsigned long val) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    virtual bool set_batch_latency(uint32_t id, unsigned long val) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    virtual bool set_attribute_int(uint32_t id, int32_t attribute, int32_t value) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    virtual bool set_attribute_str(uint32_t id, int32_t attribute, char *value, int value_len) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    virtual bool flush(uint32_t id) {\n        return true;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThe following table describes the functions of the `sensor_device` interface.\n\n**Table: sensor_device interface functions**\n\n| Prototype                                | Description                              | Return value      |\n| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| `uint32_t get_hal_version(void)`         | Returns the HAL version.                 | Version           |\n| `int get_poll_fd(void)`                  | Returns the file description to poll events. | `fd`              |\n| `int get_sensors(const sensor_info_t **sensors)` | Returns the list of supported sensors.

If many sensors are supported by a single device file, the sensorhub HAL can be configured so that it can operate each sensor as a logically-separate device.\n\nThe sensor HAL interface is provided to manufacturers and vendors through the `sensor_hal.h` and `sensor_hal_types.h` header files. It uses just 1 thread for polling sensor events from multiple device files.\n\n**Figure: Sensorhub HAL**\n\n![Sensorhub HAL](media/656px-tizen-3-sensorhub2.png)\n\nThe sensorhub HAL can be developed by using the `sensor_device` interface. An example of a sensorhub HAL can be found in the `sensor-hal-tm1/src/sensorhub` Git.\n\nIDs can be assigned by the vendor or manufacturer for the sensorhub sensors by using the following `sensor_info_t` interface:\n\n```cpp\ntypedef struct sensor_info_t {\n    uint32_t id;\n    const char *name;\n    sensor_device_type type;\n    unsigned int event_type; /* For Internal API */\n    const char *model_name;\n    const char *vendor;\n    float min_range;\n    float max_range;\n    float resolution;\n    int min_interval;\n    int max_batch_count;\n    bool wakeup_supported;\n} sensor_info_t;\n```\n\nThe following code snippet shows an example of a sensorhub HAL implementation:\n\n```cpp\n#include \n#include \n\n#include \"sensorhub.h\"\n#include

However, there is a standard kernel subsystem for sensors: the Industrial I/O (IIO) subsystem. IIO is intended to provide support for devices that are, in some sense, analog to digital or digital to analog.\nFor more information, see [https://wiki.analog.com/software/linux/docs/iio/iio](https://wiki.analog.com/software/linux/docs/iio/iio).\n\nThe following table lists some example kernel configurations.\n\n**Table: Example kernel configurations**\n\n| Sensor component   | Kernel configuration    | Device nodes                             |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Accelerometer      | `CONFIG_INPUT_KR3DH`    | `/dev/input/event0/`, `/dev/input/event1/`, `/dev/input/event2/`, `/dev/input/event3/`, `/dev/input/event4/`, `/dev/input/event5/` |\n| Proximity          | `CONFIG_INPUT_GP2A`     |                                          |\n| Light sensor       | `CONFIG_INPUT_GP2A`     |                                          |\n| Electronic compass | `CONFIG_SENSORS_AK8975` |                                          |\n\n### Project Git Repositories\n\nThe following table lists the available project Git repositories.\n\n**Table: Git repositories**\n\n| Project               | Repository                               | Description                              |\n| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `capi-system-sensor`  | `platform/core/api/sensor`               | Tizen sensor C-API                       |\n| `sensord`             | `platform/core/system/sensord`           | Sensor daemon and libraries for managing sensors and clients |\n| `sensor-hal-tm1`      | `platform/adaptation/tm1/sensor-hal-tm1` | Sensor HAL for the TM1 device                |\n| `sensor-hal-tm2`      | `platform/adaptation/tm2/sensor-hal-tm2` | Sensor HAL for the TM2 device                |\n| `sensor-hal-tw1`      | `platform/adaptation/tw1/sensor-hal-tw1` | Sensor HAL for the TW1 device                |\n| `sensor-hal-emulator` | `platform/adaptation/emulator/sensor-hal-emulator` | Sensor HAL for the emulator                  |\n\n### Testing and Verifying Sensors\n\nThe `sensor-test package`, in the `sensord` Git repository, provides `sensorctl`, a command-line tool for testing sensors. After installing `sensor-test package`, you can test sensors using the following commands:\n\n```bash\n$ sensorctl test accelerometer\n$ sensorctl test gyroscope\n$ sensorctl test accelerometer 100 /* enable accelerometer with interval 100 ms */\n$ sensorctl test accelerometer 100 1000 /* enable accelerometer with interval 100 ms and 1s batch latency */\n$ sensorctl test accelerometer 100 1000 0 /* enable accelerometer with interval 100 ms, 1s batch latency and always on option */\n$ sensorctl info accelerometer /* retrieve accelerometer sensor information */\n```\n",

It also provides porting guidelines for vendors to facilitate OAL interface development for their hardware.\n\nThe Tizen Telephony features include:\n- Telecommunication functionalities, such as call, SS, SMS, SIM, network, and packet service\n- Plug-in architecture\n\n\nTo understand the telephony implementation, you must be familiar with the following definitions:\n\n- Core object\n  - Bundle of functions and supporting database information which processes requests, responses, and notifications designated to a specific module, such as call, SS, SIM, and network.\n  - Core objects form the executable component of a Telephony module (call, SS, SIM, network)\n- Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)\n  - The HAL ensures that similar functionality is provided by various hardware (modems) from the same modem vendor.\n  - All hardware-specific changes are controlled and processed by HALs.\n  - Depending on the modem chipset, a modem driver can be required.\n- Hooks\n  - Hooks provide a mechanism to tap the requests, responses, and notifications of other Telephony modules.\n  - Hooking is a transparent mechanism and does not affect the normal processing of requests, responses, and notifications.\n\n## Tizen Telephony Architecture\n\nTizen Telephony supports plugin architecture, which provides the flexibility to include various predefined plugins in the system with little modification.\n\n**Figure: Telephony architecture**\n\n![Telephony architecture](media/telephony-arch.png)\n\nThe 3 major components of Tizen Telephony are the libraries, plugins, and server.\n\n## Telephony Libraries\n\nThere are 2 main telephony libraries:\n\n- Telephony API (TAPI) library\n\n  The TAPI library (or simply TAPI) is a standardized interface, provided as the `libtapi` package, for applications to interact with Tizen Telephony. TAPI executes in the application's context, and it provides synchronous and asynchronous APIs. The following figure shows the `libtapi` components.\n\n  **Figure: libtapi components**\n\n  ![libtapi components](media/libtapi.png)\n\n  Applications can interface to telephony features, such as call, SMS, and network, through the respective module APIs exposed in the `libtapi` library. Telephony also provides an additional library, `capi-telephony`, for third-party applications.\n\n- Core Telephony library\n\n  The Core Telephony library, provided as the `libtcore` package, provides an API framework to interwork with Tizen Telephony. The following figure shows the `libtcore` components.\n\n  **Figure: libtcore components**\n\n  ![libtcore components](media/telephony03.png)\n\n  With `libtcore`, you can:\n\n  - Create, destroy, and maintain various server components, such as the server, communicators, HALs, core objects, and plugins.\n  - Maintain storage, queue mechanism, and general utilities.\n  - Support CMUX (creation/destruction/processing).\n  - Parse AT.\n\n## Telephony Plugins\n\nThere are 4 kinds of plugins:\n\n- **Communicator plugins** interface TAPI and the telephony server. For example, the DBUS communicator (`DBUS_TAPI`) is provided by default.\n- **Modem plugins** are core functional units providing the telephony functionality. They maintain and manage the telephony states and related databases.\n- **Modem interface plugins** interface the telephony server to the communication processor. They are hardware-specific plugins which define hardware capabilities and usage. Modem interface plugins are also called HALs.\n- **Free style plugins** provide functionality independent of communication processor hardware. Examples of free style plugins are packetservice, storage, and indicator.\n\nThe following figure provides an overview of the Telephony plugin types.\n\n**Figure: Telephony plugins**\n\n![Telephony plugins](media/telephony08.png)\n\n## Telephony Server\n\nTizen Telephony runs as a Telephony server daemon, `telephony-daemon`.\n\nThe Telephony server executes as a `g-main` loop from the `glib` library.\n\n**Figure: Telephony server**\n\n![Telephony server](media/telephony09.png)\n\n## Porting the OAL Interface\n\nOEM vendors can port available plugins within Telephony as needed to support specific hardware. It is not mandatory that all plugins are ported.\n\nThis section provides guidance to OEM vendors to develop various Telephony plugins.\n\n### Plugin Descriptor\n\nEach telephony plugin must provide a descriptor structure:\n\n```cpp\nstruct tcore_plugin_define_desc {\n    /* Name of the plugin */\n    gchar *name;\n\n    /* Initializing priority of the plugin */\n    enum tcore_plugin_priority priority;\n\n    /* Plugin version */\n    int version; \n\n    /* Plugin 'load' function reference */\n    gboolean(*load)(); \n\n    /* Plugin 'init' function reference */\n    gboolean(*init)(TcorePlugin *);\n\n    /* Plugin 'unload' function reference */\n    void (*unload)(TcorePlugin *); \n};\n```\n\nThe plugin descriptor structure must be named as `plugin_define_desc`. The server obtains the address of this symbol to give control to the plugin to execute its defined functionality.\n\nThe initialization order among various Telephony plugins is based on each plugin's priority.\n\nOEMs need to specifically implement the modem and modem interface plugins to support their hardware.\n\n### Call Service Operations\n\nTo provide call services, the following functions must be implemented:\n\n```cpp\nstruct tcore_call_operations {  \n    /* Call 'dial' function reference */\n    TReturn (*dial)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n    \n    /* Call 'answer' function reference */\n    TReturn (*answer)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n    \n    /* Call 'end' function reference */\n    TReturn (*end)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n\n    /* Call 'hold' function reference */\n    TReturn (*hold)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n    \n    /* Call 'active' function reference */\n    TReturn (*active)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n    \n    /* Call 'swap' function reference */\n    TReturn (*swap)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur);\n    \n    /* Call 'join' function reference */\n    TReturn (*join)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n    \n    /* Call 'split' function reference */\n    TReturn (*split)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n};\n```\n\n### SMS Service Operations\n\nTo provide SMS services, the following functions must be implemented:\n\n```cpp\nstruct tcore_sms_operations {\n    /* For UMTS, SMS 'send' function reference */\n    TReturn (*send_umts_msg)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur);\n  \n    /* For CDMA, SMS 'read' function reference */\n    TReturn (*send_cdma_msg)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur);\n  \n    /* SMS 'read' function reference */\n    TReturn (*read_msg)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* SMS 'save' function reference */\n    TReturn (*save_msg)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* SMS 'delete' function reference */\n    TReturn (*delete_msg)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* SMS 'get sca' function reference */\n    TReturn (*get_sca)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* SMS 'set sca' function reference */\n    TReturn (*set_sca)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* SMS 'get sms params' function reference */\n    TReturn (*get_sms_params)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* SMS 'set sms params' function reference */\n    TReturn (*set_sms_params)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n};\n```\n\n### Network Service Operations\n\nTo provide network services, the following functions must be implemented:\n\n```cpp\nstruct tcore_network_operations {\n    /* Network 'search' function reference */\n    TReturn (*search)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* Network 'set plmn selection mode' function reference */\n    TReturn (*set_plmn_selection_mode)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n    \n    /* Network 'get plmn selection mode'' function reference */\n    TReturn (*get_plmn_selection_mode)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* Network 'set service domain' function reference */\n    TReturn (*set_service_domain)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* Network 'get service domain' function reference */\n    TReturn (*get_service_domain)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n  \n    /* Network 'set band' function reference */\n    TReturn (*set_band)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur);\n   \n    /* Network 'get band' function reference */\n    TReturn (*get_band)(CoreObject *o, UserRequest *ur); \n};\n```\n\n### HAL Operations\n\nTo provide HAL operations, the following functions must be implemented:\n\n```cpp\nstruct tcore_hal_operations {\n    /* HAL 'power' function reference */\n    TReturn (*power)(TcoreHal *hal, gboolean flag); \n  \n    /* HAL 'send' function reference */\n    TReturn (*send)(TcoreHal *hal, unsigned int data_len, void *data); \n  \n    /* Network 'set up network interface' function reference */\n    TReturn (*setup_netif)(CoreObject *co,\n                           TcoreHalSetupNetifCallback func, void *user_data,\n                           unsigned int cid, gboolean enable);\n};\n```\n\nFor sample implementations of the modem and modem interface plugins, see [Sample Modem Interface Plugin Implementation](#sample-modem-interface-plugin-implementation).\n\n## Configuration\n\nTelephony plugins must be installed in the following folders:\n\n- Modem plugins: `%{_libdir}/telephony/plugins/modems/`\n- Other plugins: `%{_libdir}/telephony/plugins/`\n\n## References\n\nTizen source site:

The server loads the modem interface plugin.\n\n   2. The modem interface plugin registers to the server.\n\n   3. The server enumerates the modem interface plugin.\n\n   4. The physical HAL is created.\n\n   5. The modem interface plugin queries the modem state.\n\n   6. If the modem is online, the CMUX (internal) channels are established.\n\n   7. A logical HAL is created for each CMUX channel and assigned to a core object type. These are updated to the mapping table.\n\n   8. The physical HAL mode is changed to `TRANSPARENT`, which disables the queue.\n\n   9. The modem interface plugin requests the server to load the modem plugin corresponding to its architecture.\n\n   10. The server loads the modem plugin.\n\n   11. The modem plugin initializes the sub-modules and creates the core objects, based on the core object types defined in the mapping table by the modem interface plugin.\n\n   12. The modem plugin notifies the server of the `PLUGIN_ADDED` event.\n\n   13. The modem notifies the communicator of the `PLUGIN_ADDED` event.\n\n   14. The communicator creates interfaces for the sub-modules present, based on the core objects created.\n\n   **Figure: Initialization sequence**\n\n   ![Telephony11.png](media/telephony11.png)\n\n\n\n- Request processing sequence\n   1. The application request is sent to the communicator through TAPI.\n\n   2. The communicator creates a user request based on the incoming request.\n\n   3. The user request is dispatched to the communicator.\n\n   4. The communicator dispatches the user request to the server.\n\n   5. The server finds the plugin based on the modem name.\n\n   6. The server extracts the core object type from the plugin's core objects list, based on the request command.\n\n   7. The server dispatches the user request to the core object.\n\n   8. The core object dispatches the user request to dispatch a function based on the request command.\n\n   9. A pending request is formed, added to the queue, and sent to the logical HAL assigned to the core object.\n\n   10. The logical HAL dispatches the request data to its dedicated CMUX channel.\n\n   11. CMUX encodes the request data and dispatches it to the physical HAL.\n\n   12. The physical HAL sends the request data to the modem.\n\n   **Figure: Request processing sequence**\n\n   ![Request processing sequence](media/telephony11.png)\n\n\n- Response processing sequence\n   1. The modem sends response data to the physical HAL.\n\n   2. The physical HAL dispatches the response data to CMUX.\n\n   3. CMUX decodes the received response data and dispatches it to the corresponding logical HAL, based on the CMUX channel.\n\n   4. The logical HAL dispatches the decoded response data to the corresponding core object.\n\n   5. The core object processes the received response data and extracts the user request from the pending queue. It sends the response data corresponding to the user request.\n\n   6. The user request extracts the communicator.\n\n   7. The received response data is sent to the corresponding communicator.\n\n   8. The communicator sends the response data to TAPI, which communicates it to the application.\n\n   **Figure: Response processing sequence**\n\n   ![Response processing sequence](media/telephony12.png)\n\n\n- Indication processing sequence\n   1. The modem sends notification data to the physical HAL.\n\n   2. The physical HAL dispatches the notification data to CMUX.\n\n   3. CMUX decodes the received notification data and dispatches it to the corresponding logical HAL, based on the CMUX channel registered for the notification.\n\n   4. The logical HAL dispatches the decoded notification data to the corresponding core object registered for the notification.\n\n   5. The core object processes the received notification data and dispatches to the server.\n\n   6. The server dispatches the notification data to the corresponding communicator.\n\n   7. The communicator sends the notification data to TAPI, which communicates it to the application.\n\n   **Figure: Indication processing sequence**\n\n   ![Telephony13.png](media/telephony13.png)\n",

In such cases, clear the Git HEAD and try running the repo commands through the `tsocks` proxy:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ tsocks curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo\n    $ tsocks repo init -u ssh://@review.tizen.org:29418/scm/manifest -b tizen -m ivi.xml\n    $ tsocks repo init -u https://:@review.tizen.org/gerrit/p/scm/manifest -b tizen -m ivi.xml\n    ```\n\n  - When initializing and cloning through HTTP, you can be blocked by the \"server certificate verification\" issue. Run the following command and try again:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1\n    ```\n",

Delete errors in the Problems view.\n    3. Clean and build the project again.\n\n- Native IDE\n\n  - Unit test\n    - Currently, the unit test is designed to support only functional testing\n    - Unit Test application is not an OSP-based application. Therefore, some methods related with OSP application framework, such as methods of the Tizen::Base::String class, can behave incorrectly.\n    - The Test Explorer does not work if the project files have not been changed. In this case, edit the code manually, build the project, and run it.\n  - Valgrind\n    - Valgrind profiling is only supported in the Emulator\n\n- Emulator\n\n  - If you run the Emulator with Oracle Java 1.7 or higher on Mac OS, it may result in your host machine getting slower. If you run two or more Emulator VMs, Occasionally booting the Emulator does no work.\n\n  - Your Ubuntu desktop session can be occasionally logged out when launching the Emulator Manager, if you use NVIDIA graphic card. In that case, install the latest driver directly from the NVIDIA website.\n\n  - OpenGL ES acceleration can have problems in certain environments:\n\n    - Windows XP/7 with Intel motherboard integrated card\n    - Ubuntu 11.10 with Intel CPU/motherboard integrated card\n\n    If this occurs, you can launch the Emulator by switching off the HW GL acceleration in the Emulator Manager. However, you cannot use any GL-related applications, such as a Web browser.\n\n  - When you launch the Emulator on Windows, you can get a \"failed to allocate memory\" error. In that case, try the following:\n\n    - Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by running the \"bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072\" command on the console with administrator rights (Windows 7 only)\n    - Close some other programs and try to launch the Emulator again\n    - If you have set the RAM size as 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change the RAM size to 512 MB\n\n  - Using the Emulator with SOCKS (SOCKet Secure) proxy on Mac OS X can cause unexpected problems\n\n  - You cannot play all video files that are linked in YouTube or other Web pages and require the browsers registered to them\n\n  - The Emulator log file (emulator.log) can become too large if you run the Emulator for a long time\n\n- Dynamic analyzer\n\n  - A screenshot is sometimes not taken if the screen or scene change is implemented using an animation technique\n  - The analysis of the IME and Service Applications is not supported\n\n- Install Manager\n\n  - A shortcut is not provided in Mac OS X\n\n",

Use the HTML standard instead (input, video, and audio elements).\n  - The gallery3D, split view, and virtual grid widgets have been deprecated.\n\n**Fixed Bugs**\n\n- Web UI Framework (TAU)\n  - The issue of the ‘refresh’ method of the listview winset not working properly has been fixed.\n  - The broken button style has been fixed.\n\n##### Native Framework\n\nThe Tizen platform provides a new API for native applications in Tizen 2.3, replacing the previous Tizen 2.2.1 Native API. The primary development language for native applications has changed from C++ to C. However, the C++ standard library has been provided as an open source library, so C++ can still be used to create the application logic that does not use any Tizen platform features. This big change has been made for the following reasons:\n\n- The Tizen native framework currently only supports the mobile profile. However, in the near future, multiple other device profiles, such as wearable and TV will be supported. A new Native API is required to ensure that the native framework is lightweight and fast to run well on both low- and high-end profiles and devices.\n- With the new native framework, minimal porting effort is required to run native applications on multiple Tizen device profiles.\n- Improved scalability, and fast, themeable, and easily customizable graphics are now possible by using the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL).\n- More than 10 open source libraries are now available to 3rd party applications through the native framework. This is particularly advantageous for developers who are already familiar with some of these libraries, because they can quickly add features and use previous written code in certain cases.\n\nNote that you cannot use the new Tizen 2.3 SDK to develop native applications that have been written with the older Tizen SDKs. If you want to develop a native application written with an older Tizen SDK, rewrite your application with the new Tizen 2.3 SDK. The signature changes of Native APIs from Tizen 2.3 Beta to Tizen 2.3 release can be found from [here](http://download.tizen.org/misc/change-log/Native%20API%20Changes.pdf).\n\nThe new Tizen Native API includes the following API modules and features:\n\n- Application Framework API Module\n  - Application model\n    - The UI application model.\n    - The service application model. Service applications run in the background without a graphical user interface.\n  - Application controls\n    - The framework to share application functionalities with other applications.\n    - Explicit and implicit application control resolution. This enables you to specify a specific application or give the user a choice of applications when launching another application from your application for a specific task.\n  - Data controls\n    - The framework to exchange data between applications by allowing an application to query the public database of another application that has opted to be a data provider.\n  - Package management\n    - Retrieving information about installed packages.\n    - Application-specific metadata in the application manifest.\n    - Package filtering and package application filtering to get an installed package list more effectively.\n    - Retrieving package information from a specific Tizen package file.\n  - Message port\n    - Sending messages to the message ports of another application.\n    - Receiving messages from other applications.\n    - Trusted communication between applications.

While downloading, the number of the progress indicator is not changed. \n- Native IDE\n  - Generating the res.xml file in Multi-Packaged projects is not available.\n  - When you import some projects generated from the Tizen 2.3 Rev2 SDK, the importing can take some time.\n- Emulator\n  - To use the Tizen Emulator, you must install an Intel VTx supported by the CPU, and the latest version of the graphic card driver which the vendor provides. Check the prerequisites for the Tizen Emulator from:\n    - [https://developer.tizen.org/downloads/sdk/installing-sdk/prerequisites-tizen-sdk](https://developer.tizen.org/downloads/sdk/installing-sdk/prerequisites-tizen-sdk)\n    - If the host machine is using Nvidia Optimus™ technology on either Ubuntu™ or Windows, set the Tizen Emulator to run with your Nvidia graphics card. In case of Ubuntu™, check the bumblebee project ([https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee)). In case of Windows, select \"High Speed NVIDIA Processor\" as \"Preferred Graphics processor\" in the Nvidia control panel.\n    - On Ubuntu™, if the graphics driver is out-of-date, your Ubuntu desktop session can be occasionally logged out when launching the Emulator Manager. Or the Emulator skin can be drawn improperly. Check the prerequisites and upgrade the latest graphics driver.\n  - On Ubuntu™ 14.04, the shortcut menu can sometimes appear transparently.\n  - On Windows, depending on your OS theme (such as Non-Aero themes and Windows XP themes), a display surface can be erased for a while if the Emulator window is covered with another window. If you click the Emulator window, the display surface runs correctly again.\n  - On Windows, if ‘failed to allocate memory’ error occurs while executing the Emulator, try the following:\n    - Close some other programs and try to launch the Emulator again.\n    - If the RAM size is set as 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change the RAM size to 512 MB.\n    - Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by typing the bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072 command on the console with administrator rights (Windows 7 only) and reboot.\n  - If you use a MacBook Pro which has both Intel HD and NVidia GPUs, when you execute the Emulator with the OpenGL ES ver. v1.1 & v2.0 option, the Emulator can be unexpectedly terminated. Use the OpenGL ES ver. v2.0 & v3.0 option.\n- SDB\n  - To use the SDB bash completion feature, you must type the source .sdb-complete.bash command on the bash shell. The feature runs manually from the Tizen 2.4 due to the Installer and Update Manager issue.\n\n#### UI FW\n\nNew Features\n\n-  Tizen 2015 UX support has been added (new winset and style).\n-  Vector winset support has been added.\n-  Unicode 6.1 Colored Emoticons have been added.\n-  Gamepad support has been added.\n-  Cancel Event support has been added.\n-  ATK has been integrated.\n-  Ecore Buffer has been added.\n  -

Key features in this milestone include:\n\n- 2.4 API compatibility  \nThe 3.0 TV and mobile profiles are backward-compatible with the 2.4 public API (both native API and Web API). The 2.4 API list is to be published at [https://developer.tizen.org/development](https://developer.tizen.org/development).\n- 64-bit support  \n64-bit SoC has been tested and verified with 3.0 TV and mobile profiles. 32-bit hard-coded source code has been modified and core components have been re-factored to support both 32-bit and 64-bit SoC. LTP (Linux Testing Project) and TCT (Tizen Compliance Tests) were used to verify behavioral correctness.\n- Multi-user architecture  \nThe 3.0 TV and mobile profiles support multi-user architecture for multi-user/single-login usage. Many services have been moved to user session from system session and the global application and user-specific application concepts have been introduced. This feature enables easy personalization on shared devices, such as tablets and TVs.\n- New security architecture: 3 domain smack and Cynara  \nThe security server and privilege manager have been replaced with security manager and Cynara, respectively. Platform components are categorized depending on their usage domain and the security manager auto-generates the smack rule for each component, rather than based on the module developer.\n- Wayland display server  \nThe X server has been replaced with Wayland in this version. The full specification of the Wayland protocol has been implemented based on Enlightenment 19 and other core platforms, such as AppFW and SystemFW, and the Web engine has been aligned with those changes. This new display server reduces application launch time and computation resource consumption by about 30%, compared to the previous version.\n- Blink-based Web engine  \nWebkit2 has been replaced with Chromium-efl and core components interacting with the Web engine have been re-designed/re-implemented for the new WRT and browser.\n- Buxton2  \nBuxton2 has been introduced. Buxton2 provides a secure configuration service based on Cynara and has been re-implemented with consideration for multi-user and recovery support.\n- IoTivity integration  \nIoTivity 0.9.2 has been integrated into the 3.0 TV and mobile profiles. Simple APIs for this framework are scheduled for the next milestone release.\n- Murphy  \nA generic policy manager, Murphy, has been integrated into the 3.0 platform. In the M1 release, this manager is only used to control audio session resource conflict scenarios.\n- Linux kernel  \nThe Linux kernel 4.0 is provided.\n\n## Coming in M2 Release\n\n- KDBus  \nIntegration and hardening of the KDBus feature into the platform, which makes DBus-based IPC faster.\n- Crosswalk for Tizen  \nCrosswalk for Tizen is under development.\n- IoTCon API  \nResource model for typical usage on Tizen devices is abstracted and wrapped with the IoTCon API.\n- Linux kernel  \nThe Linux kernel 4.1 is to be provided.\n- Emulator  \nThe 32-bit/64-bit emulator is being stabilized.\n\n## Known issues\n\n- First screen resizing during application launch  \nThe root cause of this issue is a lack of synchronization between EFL and Wayland for first scene drawing. This bug is to be resolved before the M2 release.\n- DBus privilege bug  \nThis issue is not caused by the platform module but the DBus configuration for the service adaptor module. It is already fixed but has not been applied to M1 binary, since the bug was discovered very late. This bug is to be resolved before the M2 release.\n\nIf you encounter problems with the Tizen milestone release, you are encouraged to interact directly with the Tizen platform developers by subscribing to the tizen dev mailing list.\n",

            "content": "# Tizen RT\n\nTizen has been commercialized in smart TVs, smart phones, wearable devices (Gear S, Gear Fit), and smart home appliances. However, low-end and low-cost IoT devices, such as home appliances without LCDs and wearable bands with small LCDs, have received less attention. The goal of Tizen RT is to extend the Tizen platform device coverage to these low-end devices. Tizen RT is an RTOS-based lightweight platform that works on these devices, which typically use Cortex-M/R processors with MPU, less than 2 MB RAM, and less than 16 MB flash memory.\n\nThe typical RTOS-based development environment has several limitations:\n\n- It cannot load additional modules at runtime.\n- It can be inferior to a Linux environment.\n\nTo tackle these limitations, Tizen RT adopts Linux-style development environments, including POSIX API, BSD Socket API, Shell, and Kconfig build configuration. This helps Linux developers build their business logics easily on top of Tizen RT. In 2017, Tizen RT adopts a lightweight JavaScript environment, consisting of JerryScript and IoT.js.\n\nTizen RT consists of a lightweight RTOS (TinyAra), IoT protocols (such as IoTivity and LWM2M), and JerryScript/IoT.js.\n\n**Figure: Tizen RT content**\n\n![Tizen RT content](media/tizen-rt-introduction.png)\n\nThe TinyAra project was started in 2015 based on NuttX, a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards compliance and a small footprint. While maintaining the kernel architecture, TinyAra has grown by building up the IPv4/IPv6 network stack, file system, a lightweight database (AraStorage), device monitor, and IoT protocols, such as IoTivity (OCF) and LWM2M. The integration of AraStorage and IoTivity allows TinyAra to collect, store, and deliver IoT sensor data easily. The combination of the device monitor, which observes the status of connectivity, power, and errors, and the lightweight M2M promotes TinyAra as a large-scale device management solution. TinyAra evolved into Tizen RT in 2016 by stacking multiple frameworks required for IoT scenarios. In 2017, Tizen RT adopts JerryScript and IoT.js, for a lightweight JavaScript environment.\n\nThe following figure illustrates Tizen RT development over 2016 and 2017. Tizen RT was first commercialized in low-end home appliances in the first half of 2017.\n\n**Figure: Tizen RT development**\n\n![Tizen RT development](media/tizen-rt-architecture.png)\n",

            "content": "# Web/Native IDE Extension Development Guide\n\nThe Tizen IDE is based on [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) and can be extended based on Eclipse's plugin extension platform. Therefore, you can contribute to it through the extensible parts of the Eclipse platform. Technically, all of the functions of Tizen IDE that provide extension points in the Eclipse platform can be extended, added, or changed. For example, the Menu, Context Menu, Toolbar, View, and Editor can all be extended.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> The Tizen IDE has modified some of the Eclipse icon images to provide a Tizen Studio identity, and some of the Eclipse platform upstream sources to customize unused menu items and settings, so some extension points do not work properly.\n\nTizen IDE extensions are developed in essentially the same way as Eclipse plugins. If you are new to Eclipse plugin development or need more information, see:\n- [Eclipse Official Help](https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fguide%2Ffirstplugin.htm)\n- [Eclipse expert Lars Vogella's blog](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugin/article.html)\n\nTo develop the Tizen IDE:\n\n1. Prepare the default Eclipse Plugin Development Environment (PDE).\n2. Clone the Tizen IDE source.\n\n## Tizen IDE Extension Points\n\nThe following figure illustrates how Eclipse plugins can function as an extension point that can be used by other plug-ins to contribute to it.\n\n**Figure: Extension points**\n\n![Extension points](media/ext-point.png)\n\nThe Tizen IDE provides the following extension points for IDE functionality:\n\n- Launch (Web)  \n  Provides extension points for application launch (the **Run As** command) and unit test launch.\n  - `org.tizen.web.zimlaunch.launchStepFactory`  \n    Web application launch step\n\n    **Figure: Web application launch**\n\n    ![Web application launch](media/launch-ext.png)\n  - `org.tizen.web.unittest.launchStepFactory`  \n    Web application unit test launch step\n     \n- Certificate  \n  Provides extension points for Tizen certificate generation. For an example, see [Modifying Certificate Manager Texts](example-web-certi-ext.md).\n\n- Eclipse themes  \n  Provides extension points for customizing the IDE:\n  - `org.eclipse.ui.commands`\n  - `org.eclipse.ui.handlers`\n  - `org.eclipse.ui.bindings`\n  - `org.eclipse.ui.menus`\n  - `org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus`\n  - `org.eclipse.ui.newWizards`\n  - `org.eclipse.ui.editors`\n  - `org.eclipse.ui.propertyPages`\n  - `org.eclipse.ui.perspectiveExtensions`\n  - `org.eclipse.help.toc`\n\n  For an example, see [Modifying Eclipse Themes](example-web-theme-ext.md).\n\nIf you have additional extension points, contact us.\n",

            "title": "Tizen Development Workflow",
            "content": "# Tizen Development Workflow\n\nThe Tizen development system has 2 main components:\n\n- **Source Code Management (SCM)** system consists of 2 parts:\n  - **Git** is a particularly powerful, flexible, and low-overhead version control system that makes collaborative development efficient and robust. For more information, see:\n    - [Git Community Book](http://git-scm.com/book)\n    - [Git Wiki](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)\n    - [Git Manual Page](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/)\n  - **Gerrit** is a Web-based code review system, facilitating online code reviews for projects using the Git version control system. By showing changes in a side-by-side display and supporting inline comments, Gerrit optimizes the code review process, enhancing review quality. Furthermore, by permitting any authorized user to submit changes to the central Git repository, Gerrit simplifies the maintenance of Git-based projects, enabling a more centralized use of Git.\n- **Open Build Service (OBS)** is an open and complete distribution development platform that provides the infrastructure for developers to easily create and release open source software for various Linux distributions on different hardware architectures. In addition, OBS delivers a collaborative environment that enables developer groups to build and submit changes to other projects.\n\n  For more information, see:\n  - [Open Build Service](http://openbuildservice.org/)\n  - [Build Service (openSUSE)](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service)\n\n\n## Git Branches\n\nA given project in the Git repository has 2 possible branches: a master branch and an upstream branch.\n\n- **Master branch**\n\n  Git introduces the master branch (also known as development branch) during the initialization of a repository, thus the default branch in a repository is the master branch and most developers keep the repository's most robust and dependable line of development on the master branch.\n\n  In other words, the master branch hosts each project's full source tree (for example, in C/C++, `.h`, and `makefile` files), including the upstream source and any Tizen local changes. Though the master branch can be renamed or even deleted, it is best practice to regard it as mandatory and leave as is.\n\n  > **Note**\n  >\n  > You are responsible for maintaining the packaging change log within the `/packaging` folder of each Git tree.\n\n- **Upstream branch**\n\n  When talking about 2 repositories that have been cloned one from the other, the parent repository is commonly referred to as being \"upstream\".\n\n  This conventional concept applies to the \"upstream branch\", as well. More specifically, a parent branch is referred to as the \"upstream branch\" on which developers base their Git projects. The upstream branch becomes optional in the following scenarios:\n\n  - The project only contains native code from Tizen and has no upstream project to base on.\n  - The project does not need to track the latest update of the upstream project.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> The master branch is mandatory, whereas the upstream branch is optional.\n\n## Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThe development workflow includes various roles and related responsibilities:\n\n- **Developers** are responsible for:\n\n  - Writing and submitting code to the development branch of a Git project.\n  - Verifying and reviewing (vote \"+1\" or \"-1\") code changes for any project on any branch.\n\n- **Maintainers** are responsible for:\n\n  - Creating additional branches, such as upstream and development branches to profile projects.\n  - Rebasing the master branch to the upstream branch.\n  - Reviewing code, as well as approving (vote \"+2\") or reject (vote \"-2\") patches.\n\n  Maintainers also must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n  - Despite the granted power, maintainers must not accept their own changes without them passing a peer review (\"+1\") or (\"+2\").\n  - The force push right is granted for maintainers to be able to handle code rebasing. Maintainers must not abuse the right to hide patch submissions that are supposed to be reviewed.\n\n- **Reviewers** are responsible for:\n\n  - Reviewing code, as well as approving (vote \"+2\") or rejecting (vote \"-2\") patches.\n\n- **Release engineers** are responsible for:\n\n  - Approving submissions to OBS.\n  - Performing smoke tests on the resulting images and transferring them to the release area for QA engineers to perform further tests.\n\n- **QA engineers** are responsible for:\n\n  - Performing thorough integration and verification of the image to eliminate regressions and bugs.\n\n## Package Development Workflow\n\nThe package development workflow is described in the following procedure and shown in the following figure.\n\n**Figure: Package development workflow**\n\n![Package development workflow](media/800px-tizen-work-flow.png)\n\n1. Developers set up the development environment and install the development tools.\n1. Developers clone the source code, do required development, and perform local verification through a local build.\n1. Developers submit patches to Gerrit for all stakeholders to review.\n1. Tizen backend service and reviewers verify the patches through automated and manual testing, respectively, and then vote \"-1\", \"0\", or \"+1\" based on the quality of the patches.\n   - Automated testing: Tizen backend service automatically submits patches to OBS to perform a remote build and then posts the test results back to Gerrit.\n   - Manual testing: Testers verify the patches manually and then publish comments on Gerrit.\n1. Maintainers approve the patches (\"Code-Review +2\") after they pass verifications (\"Verified +1\") and then merge code changes to the Gerrit repository.\n1. Maintainers and developers submit packages to OBS by using the `gbs submit` command.\n   > **Note**\n   >\n   > It is best practice to always have a maintainer role for every Tizen project, and maintainers must submit packages to OBS as soon as all merged packages are ready for submission, in order to prevent possible omissions.\n1. Tizen backend service activates pre-release and normal release processes at the same time. During the pre-release process, Tizen images that incorporate specific packages are created and submitted to release engineers for review.\n1. Release engineers accept or reject submissions based on the quality of the packages. For accepted submissions, the corresponding source code is merged into the OBS repository. Meanwhile, the normal release process takes over and publishes repositories together with Tizen images.\n\n\n### Package Generation\n\nAfter submitting code from a source repository to OBS, the backend generates the package file in the required format, by the following steps:\n\n1. Create a tarball.  \n   Create the tarball using the `git-archive` command. The `/packaging` directory must be included in the tarball as well. The tarball version is abstracted from the spec file by **rpmbuild**.\n1. Take the contents of the packaging directory and put them alongside the tarball.\n\nThe package files in the required form are shown in the following figure.\n\n**Figure: Package files**\n\n![Package files](media/700px-package-generation.png)\n",
