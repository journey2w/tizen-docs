  <li>Root daemon minimization
    <ul>
      <li>Converted root daemons to non-root permission to prevent potential attacks.</li>
      <li>Unlike the system process in Tizen 2.4, each daemon has a separate ID.
        <ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Certificates for an application with OCSP information are checked during the installation with OCSP.</li>
